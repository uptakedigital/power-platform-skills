# app-builder — capabilities

What the `/app-builder` skill can do today, and how far each capability has been proven. The build
engine is [`../scripts/lib/sdk-build.js`](../scripts/lib/sdk-build.js); the App Spec contract is
[`../references/app-spec-schema.md`](../references/app-spec-schema.md); the wiring diagrams are in
[`architecture.md`](architecture.md).

This file records **shipped** behaviour only. Planned and unbuilt work is tracked in GitHub issues —
the carried-over backlog is
[#480](https://github.com/microsoft/power-platform-skills/issues/480). A roadmap committed alongside
the code goes stale silently and states intent the code does not yet support, so the two are kept
apart deliberately.

**Evidence legend**
- ✅ **verified live** — built end-to-end on a real Dataverse environment and torn down clean.
- 🧪 **tested** — has automated (unit / golden / real-bundle) coverage, not exercised on a live org.
- ⚠ **not live-verified** — plumbed through and unit-tested, awaiting a live shakeout.

### Authoring & build framework — ✅ verified live
- Interactive levelled authoring in the **main loop** — jobs-to-be-done first, then data model,
  artifacts + page-intents, then access (env select, App Spec, lint gate, plan-mode approval).
- Deterministic, **idempotent** build engine — discovers via the SDK (`findTables`/`findColumns`/`fetchEntityMetadata`) and creates only what's missing; new / existing / mixed envs all work.
- **All Dataverse access via the vendored headless SDK**; metadata cached under `<app-folder>/.maker-workspace/` for reuse.
- Phase selection (`--only`/`--skip`/`--from`/`--to`), `[n/total]` narration, `BuildHalt` gate, dry-run by default, `--sample-data` / `--publish` opt-in.
- Bounded-concurrency for independent ops; one publish round-trip per entity + the app. `az`-token HttpClient with transient (429 / 5xx) retry.
- Guardrail lint (`spec-lint.js`) + hard validator (`app-spec.js`). 🧪 full `node:test` suite + the vendored SDK's Jest suite green (`node scripts/run-tests.js --with-sdk <ppux>`).

### Data model (Tier 1) — ✅ verified live
- All column types: Text · Memo · Choice · MultiChoice · Boolean · Money · DateTime · Integer · BigInt · Decimal · Double · File · Image · AutoNumber · Customer (with per-type options), incl. AutoNumber primary columns.
- Global option sets, status reasons (idempotent, deterministic pinned values), alternate keys (idempotent).
- Relationships: OneToMany (lookup) **and** ManyToMany; Customer (polymorphic) columns.
- Sample data: Choice/MultiChoice label→int resolution (inline **and** global choices), `$parent`/`$parents` lookup binds (incl. junction rows with both sides), custom status reasons; resolve-by-name idempotency via the SDK's `seedRecordGraph`.
- ⚠ Calculated / Rollup formula columns — `source` + `formula` plumbed through, **not live-verified**.
- **Per-column write permissions** (`isValidForCreate` / `isValidForUpdate` / `isValidForRead`) —
  this is how a column is made read-only. Applied on create **and** reconciled on rebuild, and each
  flag is sent independently so setting one does not disturb the others. Live-verified by reading the
  deployed metadata back: `IsValidForUpdate: false` with Create/Read untouched at `true`, and
  unchanged through a download → rebuild round trip (an omitted setting means *leave alone*, never
  *reset*). Not available on `Customer` columns — the SDK has no update path for that type at all.
  (AB#6651276)
- **Boolean `defaultValue`** — which option a Yes/No column starts on; the SDK previously hardcoded
  `false`. An explicit `false` is preserved rather than treated as absent. Live-verified.
  (AB#6648523)
- **Whole-number `integerFormat`** — `None` · `Duration` · `TimeZone` · `Language` · `Locale`; the
  SDK previously hardcoded `None`, so a column holding minutes could not render as a duration.
  Live-verified as `Duration`. (AB#6648522)
- **Table icons** (`entities[].vectorIcon` = SVG web resource → `IconVectorName`; `entities[].icon` = raster web resource → `IconMediumName`) — sets a custom table's own icon (what the modern designer + nav render). Applied after the web-resources phase via the SDK's `setEntityIcon`; hard-validated against declared web resources so an unresolvable value can't break the designer (glimmer). Live-verified: `IconVectorName` set to a published SVG web resource.

### Business rules — ⚠️ environment-gated
- `businessRules[]` — declarative form logic with no code: show/hide (`SetVisibility`), lock/unlock
  (`LockUnlock`), set-required (`SetBusinessRequired`) and set-value (`SetFieldValue`), gated on one
  or more conditions over the record (ANDed). Sixteen operators, taken from the SDK's own table:
  `Equals` · `DoesNotEqual` · `IsGreaterThan` · `IsGreaterThanEqualTo` · `IsLessThan` ·
  `IsLessThanEqualTo` · `Contains` · `DoesNotContain` · `BeginsWith` · `DoesNotBeginWith` ·
  `EndsWith` · `DoesNotEndWith` · `On` · `NotOn` · `ContainsData` · `DoesNotContainData`.
- **The SDK writes a rule through the bound `CreateProcessWithWfomJson` member, or not at all.** The
  client-side workflow-XAML compiler it used to fall back on was removed upstream, because it covered
  4 of the 7 action types and a single clause and therefore silently narrowed a rule into something
  that did not say what the author wrote. An environment that does not declare that member **cannot
  host business rules** — and that is the common case rather than an edge case. Where the member is
  declared, a rule can still fail with a server-side MissingMethodException, which is a platform
  defect on that environment rather than a rule-shape problem. The build then skips them,
  warns once naming the member, and builds everything else normally; `--verify` reports them as *not
  applicable on this environment* rather than missing, so the exit code, the deployed baseline and
  the `--changed-only` snapshot are unaffected.
- The operator allowlist is load-bearing rather than cosmetic: the SDK resolves an operator it does
  not recognise to **Equals**, so `GreaterThan` (the natural misspelling of `IsGreaterThan`) would
  deploy, activate and quietly test equality. The spec pins the list against the bundle's own table
  in both directions.
- **Every rule is checked by the business-rule designer's own completeness validator before it is
  written.** The push cannot tell you a rule is wrong: a condition tree in an unexpected shape is
  merged onto the node, ignored by the serializer, and written as a rule with no clauses and no
  actions — HTTP 204, activated, and it never fires. The SDK exposes the same validator the designer
  gates its Save button on, and nothing on the push path runs it, so the build does. Findings **halt**
  the build and are reported verbatim; a bundle without the validator, or one that faults, is skipped
  rather than allowed to block a build it cannot judge. Measured against the bundle: every shape this
  spec surface can author — all sixteen operators, all four action types, every scope and status,
  multi-condition and multi-action — reports zero findings, so this cannot reject a rule that was
  previously buildable.
- `dataType` is currently **decorative** — measured across every accepted token, on both the
  condition and the action path, the SDK types every literal as `String`. It is still validated as a
  closed set so a typo is caught.
- Every field is validated against the rule's own entity, so a rule naming a column that does not
  exist is rejected up front rather than deploying and never firing.
- Additive on rebuild (matched by `entity` + `name`, reused if present); torn down with the app.
- **Activating a rule creates a second `workflows` row, and that is normal.** Dataverse keeps the
  definition (`type 1`, no parent) and an activated copy (`type 2`, parented to it). Live-measured: a
  Draft create yields one row, a plain `PATCH` to `statecode 1` yields two — and a PATCH cannot create
  anything, so the platform makes it. Every business-rule query in build, verify and teardown filters
  `type eq 1`; omitting it made the build attempt to delete the copy (405), warn about a duplicate
  that did not exist, and would have made `--verify` fail every active rule.
- Live-verified end to end through the App Spec on an environment that supports it: rules authored
  from `businessRules[]` deployed, activated, and the platform's own generated `clientdata` named the
  authored columns.

### Forms, views & charts — ✅ verified live
- Adaptive main forms (auto + explicit tabs/sections), related-record sub-grids (1:N **and** N:N), Notes/timeline section.
- Quick-create + quick-view forms (`forms[].formType`); quick-view **placement** on a host form via a lookup (`forms[].quickViews[]`).
- **Per-form security roles** (`forms[].securityRoles`) — offer a form to named `personas[]`, or to
  `everyone`, with optional `fallbackForm` and `order`. The roles are **not** a relationship
  (`systemform` reports `CanBeInManyToMany: { Value: false, CanBeChanged: false }` and there is no
  `systemformrole` entity, so no association shape can ever work); they live inside `formxml` as a
  `<DisplayConditions>` element. Note the direction: a form with **no** assignment is offered to
  **every** role, so this **restricts** a form rather than granting it — and removing a restriction
  is an explicit `everyone: true`, not deleting the block. Applied in the **security** phase, because
  the persona's role does not exist until then, and the write lands on the **unpublished** layer, so
  it takes effect after a publish. Live-verified: the persona's real role id inside
  `<DisplayConditions Order="2">` on the restricted form, `<Everyone />` on its unrestricted sibling.
  (AB#6648526)
- Form JS event handlers (`onload`/`onsave`/`onchange`) wired via web resources.
- Views with rich filters (`eq-userid`/`this-week`/`in`/`not-in`/… + Choice-label resolution); default Active/Inactive view **column enrichment** via the SDK's `enrichDefaultViews`.
- Choice-column charts.

### Custom grid rendering (preview) — ✅ SDK live-verified, environment-gated
- `entities[].columns[].visualization` — render a column as a `RadialDial`, `LineChart`, `HeatMap`
  or `StarRating` in **every** grid and view that shows it, instead of plain text. `None` clears it.
  Per-*column* metadata (a `controlconfiguration` row bound to the attribute), so it is declared once
  on the column rather than on each view.
- Type-only: the renderers use built-in defaults (dial 0–100, stars 0–5) with no tuning parameters.
  Column-type compatibility is **not** validated — the platform does not enforce a clean "numeric
  only" rule (`LineChart` is documented for a *text* column of comma-separated numbers), so guessing
  a constraint would reject valid specs. Guidance lives in the schema doc.
- Re-asserted on every build, for pre-existing columns as well as new ones, converging to a single
  configuration row. Omitting the field leaves a deployed renderer alone; `"None"` is how a spec
  actively clears one.
- **Environment-gated preview.** Where the platform has not provisioned it, the backing
  `controlconfigurations` table is absent and every call 404s; the build **skips** the step (the
  column and all other artifacts still deploy) and verify reports no divergence. Live-measured: the
  table was present on **1 of 18** test environments, so a missing renderer is an environment
  question first, not a spec bug.
- Live-verified on a provisioned environment: set from scratch, updated in place (the rebuild path),
  re-asserted without duplicating the config row, all four renderers accepted, and cleared with
  `None` — 6/6.

### App shell & navigation — ✅ verified live
- App module + sitemap; **multi-area sitemaps** — every `appShell.areas[]` maps to its own `<Area>` (icon + groups + subareas; order follows array order). The app is **self-contained for export/import**: its **sitemap** is added to the solution (componenttype 62), and its **tile icon** is an in-solution web resource — `app.icon` (a declared image web resource) or a generated default SVG — never an arbitrary external/managed icon.
- Generative pages (**genpage-first**) for overview / dashboard surfaces — uploaded via `pac model genpage upload`; the SDK finalizes the sitemap with `GenPage` subareas.
- Dashboards (chart / list / iframe / webresource tiles) with **sitemap placement** (auto-pinned as an app component). Tiles render in a **multi-column grid** (2-wide) rather than one stacked full-width column.
- Modern command-bar buttons — functional **JS on-click** + static hidden/disabled, incl. **flyout / split-button menus**.
- Web resources (JS / HTML / CSS) shipped + added to the solution; idempotent (reuse by name).

### Generative-page management — three-authority, id-based — 🧪 tested
- **Three-authority page identity.** IDENTITY = durable `<app>_pagemanifest` (key→pageId map), outranked by the spec's own `pages[].pageId` for a downloaded (edit-snapshot) spec. EXISTENCE = env-wide `pac model genpage list` — decides create-vs-reuse for crash-safe convergence (`enumerateEnv`, no `--app-id`). MEMBERSHIP = the app's sitemap `GenPageId` set, read fail-closed via `fetchSitemap` (`scripts/lib/sitemap-pages.js`) — drives placement, download enumeration, and verify. All page matching is by id, never by display name.
- **Edit-snapshot `pageId`.** Download keeps each page's deployed `GenPageId` as `pages[].pageId` in the emitted spec. On rebuild, this highest-authority id is confirmed against EXISTENCE and reused — so a downloaded app (including Maker-added pages) rebuilds without creating duplicates.
- **Validation: every page must be sitemap-placed.** A `pages[]` entry absent from the `appShell` sitemap is rejected; navigation-only (headless) pages are not supported. A "detail" page is a normal sitemap page receiving input via `pageInput`.
- **Safety HALTs:** `pages-removed` (live page dropped from spec — re-add or `--allow-destructive` detaches the nav SubArea, page left deployed), `pages-shared-across-apps` (`--allow-destructive` does NOT bypass; detach in Maker), `pages-identity-conflict`, `pages-manifest-corrupt`, `pages-existence-failed`, `pages-sitemap-read-failed`, `pages-shared-check-failed`.
- **Verify and download** match by id with exact set-equality (EXISTENCE + MEMBERSHIP); a manifest-uncorrelatable page surfaces `unableToRun`.

### AI-first features — ✅ verified live
- `ai` block → `ai-features` phase: form-fill, NL search, NL charts, M365 Copilot, and per-table Copilot **row summaries** with tailored `GptDynamicPrompt-2` prompts (auto-selected candidate tables; skips lookup/config/junction + D365-owned incident/lead/opportunity).
- **Admin-gated**: preflights each setting (`RetrieveSetting`), skips/warns when off, never fails the build. NL grid search is **environment-gated** (`EnableNLGridSearch`), not per-app. Standalone reporter `scripts/ai-preflight.js`.
- **The readiness gate is not the whole truth, and the report now says so.** A feature's gate and its
  actual setting are *different rows*, and a gate can read off while the feature is switched on at
  environment scope — so it runs in every app on that org. Live-measured: gate `EnableNLGridSearch`
  = `false` while `NLGridSearchSetting` = `2` at environment scope (NL search on), and
  `NLChartDataVisualizationSetting` = `1` by default (NL charts on). Preflight resolves the
  effective value per feature — app-scope override → environment → default — reports those as
  *in effect via the environment/default setting*, and **suppresses the admin action**, so nobody is
  sent to the admin centre to switch on something already running. A value it cannot read never
  counts as in effect, so a genuine action is never hidden.
- **Form fill is a real "off", not a naming mix-up** (measured 2026-08-28). Unlike NL search, the
  gate and the per-app setting share one name — `FormFillBarUXEnabled` — confirmed against the
  SDK's own `AI_GATE`/per-app maps, so there is no second setting hiding a different answer. It
  reads `0` at org *and* app scope, and it is `0` on **all 161** orgs in the test tenant.
- **`formFill` is the assist TOOLBAR only, and the report now says so.** "AI form fill assistance"
  is a family; `FormFillBarUXEnabled` governs one member of it. Three siblings are neither covered
  by that flag nor exposed by the App Spec: `FormFillFileUploadEnabled` (file upload),
  `FormPredictSmartPasteEnabled` (smart paste) and `FormPredictEnabled` (edit-form predictions).
  Calling the flag "Form fill" overclaimed in both directions — it reported the feature unavailable
  to someone who may have had smart paste working, and implied enabling it turned the family on. All
  four members were measured off across 40 orgs, so nothing is silently on here; exposing the
  siblings would be a feature (new spec keys plus live verification), not a rename.
- **The setting names are now pinned against the bundle.** Nothing previously did: every test
  hardcoded the same strings the source does, so an upstream rename would have left the suite green
  while the build wrote to a setting that no longer exists — the same shape as the
  `success`→`saved` rename that silently disarmed the 412 guard. `sdk-uptake-contract.test.js`
  compares `AI_APP_SETTING` to the SDK's map and asserts the gate/per-app names stay distinct.

### Business process flows — ✅ verified live
- `businessProcessFlows[]` — the staged process bar on a record: ordered `stages[]`, each with
  ordered `steps[]` bound to columns of the same table. **Every step must bind a `field`**: the
  platform refuses a step without one (`datafieldname of ControlStep cannot be null or empty`), so
  there is no field-less "checklist" step — bind a Boolean flag for a manual check-off. `status`
  defaults to `Active` because an inactive BPF is not merely inert, it is **invisible** — the stage
  bar does not render at all.
- Deployed as a `workflows` row (**category 4 / type 1 / businessprocesstype 0**) whose XAML the
  vendored SDK compiles from the authored stages; an `Active` flow is activated in the same push
  (`statecode 1` / `statuscode 2`). Every query in build, verify and teardown goes through one
  `bpfFilter`, which scopes to the DEFINITION row and excludes both the platform's activated `type 2`
  copy and same-named **task flows** (also category 4) — the two mistakes that cost real time on
  business rules.
- Additive on rebuild (matched by `entity` + `name`, reused if present, Active/Draft state converged
  in both directions, and re-added to the solution on every run so a failed component add is repaired
  rather than inherited); torn down with the app, deactivate-then-delete, before its table. Deleting
  an activated flow cascades a **backing-table** drop and regularly runs past the client's 60s HTTP
  timeout, so teardown polls the row rather than reporting a failure for work the server completed.
  A new `business-process-flows` build phase sits next to `business-rules` (16 now).
- **The derived unique name is a TABLE name, and it is guarded on both sides.** Dataverse stores the
  flow as `new_<name lower-cased, non-alphanumerics stripped>` — the derivation ignores the table
  *and* the solution's publisher prefix — and activation creates an org-owned backing table with that
  logical name. So the name collides with three things, not one: another flow, a table the spec
  declares, and anything already in the environment. The first two are rejected at the plan gate; the
  third is a build-time probe that checks **both** `workflows` (by `uniquename`) and table metadata
  (by logical name) and **halts** naming whichever owns it, instead of letting the create fail with a
  platform error about a table the author never mentioned. It runs only on the create path, never on
  reuse, and is best-effort — a diagnostic must never be the thing that breaks a build.
- **v1 is single-entity and linear on purpose.** The SDK also models cross-entity stages, branching,
  stage actions and security-role grants; the spec gate **rejects** those keys — as an allow-list at
  flow, stage *and* step level — rather than ignoring them, so a flow never quietly deploys as
  something other than what was authored. The allow-list shape matters: the SDK's normalizers copy a
  fixed key set and discard the rest, so a stage `branch` or a step's `fieldLogicalName` (instead of
  `field`) would otherwise pass validation and deploy bound to nothing. `securityRoles` needs role ids
  and belongs to the `security` phase (a BPF's grants are privileges on the backing table that
  activation creates) — tracked in
  [#513](https://github.com/microsoft/power-platform-skills/issues/513).
- **Live-verified**: build (11 created, verify 8/8), rebuild (flow reused, solution component
  re-added), and teardown (exit 0, with an independent query confirming both the workflow row and its
  activation-created backing table are gone). An invalid spec is refused pre-flight with no writes.
- Two platform facts the validator encodes, both found by adversarial review and measured against the
  bundle: a flow **name must be unique across the whole spec** (the derived `uniquename` ignores the
  table and strips case/punctuation, and activation creates a backing table with that name, so two
  colliding flows cannot both deploy); and a stage must carry **at least one step** (the SDK
  substitutes a placeholder named "New Step" for an empty stage).
- Unblocked a defect in the vendored SDK, fixed upstream and re-vendored: the hybrid XML grammar walk
  descended into TEXT nodes, and `@xmldom/xmldom` (what the SDK's DOM shim installs headlessly)
  exposes a text node's `childNodes` as `null` where jsdom returns an empty NodeList. Every BPF push
  therefore threw `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'length')` in the vendored
  bundle — input-independent — while the SDK's own jsdom-only suite stayed green. Pinned by a real-bundle
  test here and by a `@jest-environment node` regression upstream.

### Edit flow (download → edit → rebuild) — ✅ verified live
- `download-model-app.js` pulls a **deployed app** back into an editable App Spec (+ page code, icons, referenced entities, and the app's **real unmanaged solution** — `recoverAppSolution` enumerates the app's solution memberships and excludes the built-in `Active`/`Default`/`Basic` system solutions, so the spec names the right container for a later clean teardown); edit the spec and re-run the idempotent build — **create and edit share one path** (reuses app/tables, updates pages in place, keeps `GenPage` subareas). The app-shell phase **re-syncs the sitemap + components of any existing app** (fetch → recompute-from-spec → push → publish), so subarea add/rename/reorder edits land for **page-less apps too** — not just generative-page apps — and `--only app-shell` can force the rewrite. **Classic DashBoard subareas are *designed* to round-trip** — the dashboard is reconstructed into `dashboards[]` with **id-passthrough tiles** (each tile carries the deployed view/chart ids), so a rebuild recreates it against the existing views/charts without re-declaring them. **This now works end to end.** It previously did not: the vendored SDK’s `fetchArtifact(‘dashboard’, …)` threw `Cannot read properties of null (reading ‘length’)` while deserializing the `<parameters>` block it had itself serialized, so no tiles were recovered and the subarea was dropped — which failed the whole download unless `--allow-lossy-download` was passed. Root cause upstream: the grammar walk descended into **text** nodes, and the bundled XML parser returns `null` for a text node’s children. Fixed in the SDK and re-vendored; measured across the re-vendor as **0/4 → 4/4** round-trips (list tile, both chart-parameter spellings, and a tile with an empty parameter value), and pinned by `scripts/tests/dashboard-roundtrip.test.js`, which feeds a serialized dashboard straight back in. ([#478](https://github.com/microsoft/power-platform-skills/issues/478)) **Round-trip scope (not yet "complete"):** tables, sitemap/appShell, generative pages, icons, dashboards, and solution round-trip; **forms, views, charts, and commands do NOT yet** — view hydration was tried and reverted (LIVE-verified the deployed savedquery set can't reliably distinguish author views from Dataverse's auto-generated Active/Inactive/QuickFind system views). All survive on the live app (a rebuild preserves them by discovery) but are absent from the downloaded spec, so edit them in Maker or a fresh spec.
- Live regression on the edit path found + fixed **4 bugs**, then re-verified clean.
- `verify-model-app.js` — read-only reconcile of spec vs deployed (exits non-zero on anything missing). Sitemap checks are **element-scoped**: an area/subarea icon is matched on its own `<Area>`/`<SubArea>` element, and a **dashboard subarea** is verified by resolving the dashboard id (systemform type 0, by name) and matching the sitemap's `DefaultDashboard` — so a value reused elsewhere can't produce a false pass. **Multi-area sitemaps** and the dashboard-subarea path were re-verified live (positive + negative).

### Teardown — ✅ verified live
- `teardown-model-app.js` deletes exactly what an App Spec declares, in dependency-safe order (app → dashboards → commands → business rules → business process flows → forms → **security roles** → charts → views → relationships → AI row summaries → tables [children-first] → web-resources → global choices → solution). Forms/charts/views/relationships are removed **before** tables (a table delete doesn't reliably cascade cross-references); **web resources are removed AFTER tables** (a table's icon web resource is referenced by the table). A business rule / business process flow is deactivated before it is deleted, because Dataverse refuses to delete an activated process.
- **Classifier-safe** (every id resolved from a spec-declared name via an exact-match, entity-scoped filter), dry-run by default, best-effort continue, not-found aware, undeletable (system/managed) artifacts recorded as `skipped`. A **restricted system solution** (`Active`/`Default`/`Basic`) is skipped rather than attempted (Dataverse 400s any delete of one), so a downloaded spec that defaulted its solution to `Default` tears down cleanly. An already-gone relationship (Dataverse 400 *"…but 0 were found"*) is tolerated as deleted, like the table not-found case.

### Tooling & internals — ✅ verified live
- ASCII **form wireframe** preview (`preview-form.js`); phase-grouped build log with per-step status glyphs (`✓`/`⊘`/`✗`) + a closing summary.
- **SDK consolidation** — the SDK owns the Dataverse mechanics (`seedRecordGraph`, `enrichDefaultViews`, AI settings/row-summaries, artifact `resolveArtifact`/`findArtifact`/`deleteAppCascade`); the plugin keeps the judgment (spec validation, choice/status resolution, `$parent`→bind translation, candidate selection).
