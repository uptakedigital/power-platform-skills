# AGENTS.md — Model Apps Plugin

This file provides guidance to AI Agents when working with the **model-apps** plugin.

## What This Plugin Is

A plugin for building Power Apps for **model-driven apps**. Two **authoring** skills do the work
(plus `/report-issue` and `/telemetry` — four user-invocable skills in total):

- **`/genpage`** — build and deploy standalone **generative pages** (genux): React 17 + TypeScript +
  Fluent UI V9 single-file components, deployed via PAC CLI. Orchestrates specialist agents (planner,
  optional entity builder, parallel page builders).
- **`/app-builder`** *(Preview)* — build and edit a **whole model-driven app** (tables, columns,
  relationships, adaptive forms, views, charts, generative pages, app + sitemap, sample data, and
  admin-gated AI features) from a natural-language intent, via the vendored headless `cds-maker-sdk`.

**The two authoring skills are independent entry points — neither requires the other.** Use `/genpage`
to add pages to an app that already exists; use `/app-builder` to build or edit a whole app.
`/app-builder` does *reuse* `genpage-page-builder` to generate its page `.tsx` (Phase 1.5), but that
is an implementation detail of code generation, not a dependency: `/genpage` never invokes
`/app-builder`, and `/app-builder` never invokes the `/genpage` skill. They install together (the
marketplace copies the whole plugin directory), but **either can be invoked without the other, and
neither leaves state the other depends on**. Keep it that way — shared **agents and libraries** are
fine, a skill-to-skill call is not, and neither may write a file the other treats as authoritative
(this is why `write-page-plan.js` emits `app-builder-page-plan.md`, not `genpage-plan.md`).

Plus **`/report-issue`** to file bugs against this repo. All Dataverse mutation flows through the
shared, vendored SDK (`scripts/vendor/cds-maker-sdk.cjs`) — see `## Building & Testing`.

**Requirements:**
**Requirements:**
- **PAC CLI > 2.10.0** — for app and generative-page deploy operations (incl. the genpage `upload` connector/Custom API flags)
- **Azure CLI (`az`)** — Dataverse Web API auth (SDK + entity builder); must be logged in with the
  same identity as the active `pac` profile

No Dataverse Skills plugin or Python dependency.

## Documentation Map

Keep these in sync — **update the relevant doc(s) in the same PR as the change** (a reviewer should be
able to tell what moved from the docs alone):

| Doc | What it holds | Update when… |
|-----|---------------|--------------|
| `AGENTS.md` (this file — `CLAUDE.md` symlinks to it) | Per-component behavioral specs, the canonical file tree, conventions, build/test | You add/rename a script, change a component's behavior, or change how to build/test |
| [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) | Wiring / flow **diagrams** for both skills (`/genpage` + `/app-builder`) | You change the orchestration, phase pipeline, or how the pieces connect |
| [`docs/app-builder-capabilities.md`](docs/app-builder-capabilities.md) | `/app-builder` **capabilities** — what ships today, with the evidence for each | You ship an app-builder capability |
| [`docs/app-builder-design.md`](docs/app-builder-design.md) | `/app-builder` **design record** — Part I staged-flow architecture (**cited from code by section number — never renumber**), Part II the `--changed-only` contract | You change the staged flow or the partial-apply contract |
| [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) | Keep-a-Changelog — concise bullets (detail lives in PRs/docs) | Any user-visible change |
| [`references/app-spec-schema.md`](references/app-spec-schema.md) | The App Spec contract | You change the App Spec shape or validation |

Don't duplicate content across these — **cross-link instead** (a second copy only drifts, as the file
tree and teardown order both did before).

**This repo is public.** Before adding to any of these docs, re-read the repo-root `AGENTS.md` →
*"This Repo Is PUBLIC"*. The docs here have already had to be scrubbed once for internal repo paths,
a real Dataverse environment name, review provenance, and indexes into documents an outside reader
cannot open. Record that kind of context in the PR conversation instead.

## app-builder — intent → model-driven app

A second skill (`/app-builder`) builds a whole **model-driven app** (tables, columns,
relationships, adaptive forms with sub-grids, views, Choice-column charts, app module +
sitemap) from a natural-language intent — distinct from `/genpage`, which builds generative
*pages*. The **whole flow runs in the main conversation loop, never a `Task` subagent** — subagents
are headless, so `AskUserQuestion` and plan mode cannot reach the user. For the end-to-end flow,
stage→phase mapping and page-identity model, see
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) → `## /app-builder — build pipeline`; that doc owns
the pipeline and delegates each script's **behavioral spec** to the entries below.

- **`references/authoring-flow.md`** — the Phase-1 authoring playbook the skill executes itself:
  validate prereqs, select the env via PAC (`pac auth list` / `pac org who`), detect existing
  tables/apps, author the **App Spec** in confirmed levels (**(a0) personas & jobs-to-be-done
  first** — they drive which tables and surfaces exist — then data model, then forms/views/charts +
  page-intents + sample data, then access), run the `spec-lint.js` guardrail, get plan-mode approval.
  Writes `app-spec.json` (the machine contract) + `model-app-plan.md` (rendered by
  `scripts/write-app-spec-doc.js`, never hand-written).
  **Artifact naming:** both skills derive their working directory from a slug off the user's
  request, so they can land on the SAME folder and file names are a namespace. A file written by
  BOTH is unprefixed (`workflow-log.md`); a file owned by ONE is prefixed with it
  (`genpage-plan.md`, `genpage-entity-creation-log.md`, `app-builder-page-plan.md`). A name chosen
  to prevent confusion must not *contain* the name it guards against — see
  `scripts/write-page-plan.js` for why the app-builder page plan is not `genpage-*`.
- **`scripts/lib/spec-lint.js`** — pure App Spec guardrail (`lintAppSpec → { ok, errors,
  warnings }`): errors block the plan gate (e.g. the relationship-name-vs-lookup-name
  collision Dataverse rejects), warnings teach.
- **`scripts/build-model-app.js` → `scripts/lib/sdk-build.js`** — the deterministic, **idempotent**
  build engine, run after approval. Runs in two engine invocations (staged flow): (1) `--stage data
  --apply` materializes tables + columns + relationships (solution·data-model only; sample-data
  deferred) so `generate-types` can emit `RuntimeTypes.ts`; (2) a full `--apply` build (re-discovers
  the data model, then ui · app · publish) finalizes everything idempotently. `--stage
  <data|ui|app|publish>` selects phases by stage name; **apply-safe only for `data`** — the full
  build (run 2) is always a complete idempotent run. Discovers existing tables/columns/relationships via the SDK
  (`findTables`/`findColumns`/`fetchEntityMetadata`) and creates only what's missing
  (`createSolution`/`createTable`/`createColumn`/`createRelationship`), seeds sample data via
  `seedRecordGraph` (SDK-owned parent-bind + resolve-by-name idempotency), enriches default
  Active/Inactive views via `enrichDefaultViews`, then
  `createWebResource` for form JS, then builds each artifact through the SDK's **generic mutation
  surface** (`createArtifact`+`addElement`/`updateElement`/`removeElement`+`pushArtifact`) driven by the
  pure **`scripts/lib/artifact-intent.js`** compiler: a form is a minimal `createArtifact` plus a coarse
  `addElement` of each authored tab (sub-grids/quick-views are canonical control cells; form JS is the
  root-bag `/bag/c` `<events>` region), a view is `updateElement('/columns')`, an app is
  `updateElement('/siteMap')`, a dashboard tile is `addElement('/components')`. Form reconcile adds the
  spec's fields and — for an author-controlled **explicit** layout — prunes fields it dropped (never the
  primary) via `findFieldCellPointer`+`removeElement`, keyed by a declared semantic identity so a rebuild
  never duplicates a control. Every push routes through `requireSuccessfulPush` (a 412 version conflict
  halts the build for a fresh download instead of silently dropping the edit) — so new, existing, and mixed
  envs all work. The data model is **complete** (all column types, global choices, status reasons,
  alternate keys, N:N). It also builds **quick-create/quick-view forms** (`formType`) with **quick-view
  placement** (`forms[].quickViews[]` — embed a QuickView form via a lookup), **modern command-bar
  buttons** (`commands[]` — functional JS on-click + static hidden/disabled, incl. **flyout/split-button
  menus** via `type`+`children[]`), and **dashboards** (`dashboards[]` — chart/list/iframe/webresource
  tiles) with **sitemap placement** (a `dashboard` subarea auto-pins the dashboard as an app component).
  It also builds **business process flows** (`businessProcessFlows[]` — the staged process bar on a
  record): a `workflows` row of category 4 / type 1 / businessprocesstype 0 whose XAML the SDK compiles
  from ordered `stages[]`/`steps[]`, activated in the same push. The phase is additive
  discover-reconcile keyed on `(entity, name)` like `business-rules` — it creates what is missing and
  converges only Active/Draft **state**, never stage structure — and `bpfFilter` scopes every query in
  build/verify/teardown to the DEFINITION row, excluding both the platform's activated `type 2` copy and
  same-named TASK flows (also category 4). v1 is deliberately single-entity and linear: cross-entity
  stages, branching, stage actions and `securityRoles` are **rejected at the spec gate** rather than
  silently dropped, because the build cannot yet verify them (a BPF's role grants are privileges on the
  backing table that ACTIVATION creates, so they belong to the `security` phase). The rejection is an
  **allow-list at flow, stage AND step level**, because the SDK's normalizers copy a fixed key set and
  discard the rest — so a `branch` written on a stage (where the SDK actually models it), or the very
  plausible `fieldLogicalName` instead of `field` on a step, would otherwise validate clean and deploy
  as if it had never been written. Two further platform facts the validator encodes: a flow's **name
  must be unique across the whole spec**, because the SDK derives `uniquename` as
  `new_<name lowercased, non-alphanumerics stripped>` — **ignoring the table** — and activation creates
  a backing table with that name; and a stage must carry **at least one step**, because the SDK
  substitutes a placeholder step named "New Step" for an empty one (its own `stage-needs-step` rule
  never fires, as the placeholder is injected before it looks).
  Following a **genpage-first policy**, overview/dashboard/analytics surfaces are authored as **generative
  pages** (`pages[]`) rather than classic dashboards — the build's `pages` phase uses a **three-authority
  model**: IDENTITY (durable `<app>_pagemanifest`, outranked by a downloaded spec's `pages[].pageId`),
  EXISTENCE (env-wide `pac model genpage list` — crash-safe create-vs-reuse via `enumerateEnv`), and
  MEMBERSHIP (the app's sitemap `GenPageId` set, read fail-closed via `fetchSitemap` in
  `scripts/lib/sitemap-pages.js` — drives placement, download enumeration, and verify; a read failure
  HALTs). All page matching is by id. Every `pages[]` entry must be sitemap-placed (validation rejects
  headless pages) — because the sitemap is download's ONLY membership oracle, so a page reached only
  by `navigatesTo` is invisible to download and gets re-created as a duplicate on the next build.
  The corollary is that a detail page is reachable from the nav with **no input**, so a page
  declaring `pageInput` must also declare **`directEntry`** (`selector` | `emptyState`) saying what
  that renders; `page-plan` passes it to the generator and the page manifest carries it through
  download. Every `pageInput.data` key must also be produced by an incoming `navigatesTo[].data`
  edge. See `references/app-spec-schema.md` → *the input contract*.
  The build halts on safety violations (`pages-removed`, `pages-shared-across-apps`,
  identity conflicts, read failures). The cross-app shared-page scan (`fetchAppsForPages`) enumerates every app via the vendored SDK's
  `@odata.nextLink` pagination (`queryRecords({ paginate:true })`), so it verifies EVERY app in the
  environment rather than one 5000-row page; a pagination fault (the SDK's repeated-nextLink guard) still
  fails **closed** rather than scanning a partial list. Classic `dashboards[]` are opt-in.
  **All of the build's Dataverse access is via the SDK** (see "Dataverse Access From Scripts" for the
  sanctioned exceptions elsewhere), so metadata is persisted under
  `<app-folder>/.maker-workspace/` for reuse/edits. The 16 phases
  (`solution·data-model·sample-data·web-resources·views·charts·forms·business-rules·business-process-flows·commands·dashboards·app-shell·pages·ai-features·security·publish`)
  are unchanged; independent ops run with bounded parallelism.
  Emits `[n/total]` events the orchestrator narrates + a `BuildHalt` it gates on. Dry-run by
  default; `--apply` writes, `--sample-data` / `--publish` opt-in (`--publish` gates the final *bulk*
  publish; edit/finalize paths — reconciling an existing form/view, form events, quick-views,
  existing-app sitemap, page finalize — still publish their one artifact so the change takes effect).
  **The modern ("new look") shell is opt-in via `app.newLook`.** It is a per-app SETTING
  (`NewLookAlwaysOn`, written through the SDK's `saveSettingValue` scoped to app + solution), NOT an
  app-module column — `navigationtype` is Single/Multi *session* and unrelated, which is the reason
  this looked unavailable for a long time. Best-effort: the feature rolls out by tenant, so a failure
  warns and records `created.newLook: false` rather than failing an otherwise-good build or reporting
  a silent success.
  **DATA-MODEL Dataverse labels are stamped with the ORGANIZATION's base language, not a hardcoded
  1033.** `resolveLanguageCode` (`scripts/lib/entity-provision.js`) reads `organization.languagecode`
  once per build and threads it into every label-emitting SDK call in that phase (tables, columns,
  customer columns, global choices, status reasons, alternate keys, relationships); precedence is
  `--language-code` → App Spec `languageCode` → the org's base language → 1033. Without this, an org
  that has not provisioned 1033 fails the data-model phase with `The language code 1033 is not a valid
  language for this organization`
  ([#447](https://github.com/microsoft/power-platform-skills/issues/447)) — and confusingly only on
  *some* column types, because (observed 2026-08) Dataverse tolerates an unprovisioned LCID on
  `EntityMetadata` and `PicklistAttributeMetadata` but rejects it on `DateTime`/`Memo`. Every fallback
  to 1033 warns, as does an explicitly supplied LCID that had to be discarded.
  An **explicitly supplied** LCID is additionally checked against `RetrieveProvisionedLanguages`
  (`readProvisionedLanguages`, `scripts/lib/dataverse-auth.js`, injected as `deps.provisionedLanguages`)
  and halts the data-model phase before any write if the org does not have it — because of the
  split behaviour above, the alternative is a table created with silently-wrong labels followed by a
  failure on the first `DateTime`/`Memo` column. Only *explicit* overrides are probed; the org's base
  language is provisioned by definition. The probe is best-effort — an unreachable or non-2xx
  `RetrieveProvisionedLanguages` resolves to `null` ("unknown") and the build proceeds unchanged, so
  the diagnostic can never itself break a build. Note
  `updateTable(logical, { quickCreateEnabled })` deliberately passes no language: it only builds a
  Label when a `displayName`/`pluralName`/`description` is supplied, and otherwise round-trips
  Dataverse's own labels under `MSCRM.MergeLabels`.
  **Scope — this now extends to the `forms`, `dashboards` and `app-shell` phases too.** Those go
  through the vendored SDK's artifact serializers, which used to hardcode `1033` into FormXML
  (`<label languagecode="1033">`), SiteMap XML (`<Title LCID="1033">`) and dashboard XML with **no
  caller override** ([#455](https://github.com/microsoft/power-platform-skills/issues/455)). The SDK
  now takes the authoring LCID as a **construction-time** option (`MakerSdkOptions.languageCode`),
  which is why `main()` resolves the language over the transport hatch (`resolveAuthoringLanguage`,
  `scripts/lib/entity-provision.js`) **before** calling `makeSdk`, and passes the identical value on
  as `opts.preResolvedLanguageCode` so the data-model phase cannot resolve a different one. Both SDK
  instances get the same LCID deliberately: `pushArtifact` refuses a push whose stored artifact
  language disagrees with the SDK performing it (`ARTIFACT_LANGUAGE_MISMATCH`, for registrations
  marked `languageSensitive` — App, Form, Dashboard). Passing nothing preserves the SDK's own 1033
  default exactly, so the option is opt-in rather than a silent re-labelling.
  Note the SDK deliberately does **not** language-parameterize BusinessRule: its mapper's language
  parameter is the *environment base* language, a different concept.
  Guarded by `scripts/tests/lcid-real-bundle.test.js`, which drives the REAL vendored bundle — a mock
  would keep passing against a bundle that ignored the option.
  `--verify` (opt-in) auto-runs the read-only reconcile after a successful apply and exits non-zero on a silent partial build (the same
  check `verify-model-app.js` runs standalone). Recovery from a halted build is a full rerun (idempotent).
  **`--changed-only`** (Preview, off by default) is a fail-closed SAFE partial apply: after a FRESH
  `--apply --changed-only` baseline, a later `--apply --changed-only` for a page `.tsx` byte edit runs ONLY
  the pages phase (uploads just the changed page, skips the full build) — gated on an identity-bound
  snapshot (`.maker-workspace/apply-snapshot.json`); any non-page edit (or an edit to a pre-existing app)
  falls back to a full build. Teardown tombstones+deletes the snapshot. See
  [`docs/app-builder-design.md`](docs/app-builder-design.md) for the v1 scope + contract.
  **App TABLE components are pinned by OData REFERENCE** (ADO 6612527). The SDK sends
  `{ '@odata.id': '<EntitySetName>(<MetadataId>)' }` per sitemap table, NOT an `@odata.type` instance:
  `Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.entity` names a real Dataverse table (metadata-as-data), so the old instance
  payload pinned the `entity` TABLE and every app exported as
  `<AppModuleComponent type="1" schemaName="entity" />`. The **set segment** decides the resulting
  `objectid`; an unknown set 400s, so a typo cannot silently pin the wrong table. The reference form is
  also the ONLY one that can express an abstract EDM table (`activitypointer`, `principal`), which an
  instance payload rejects outright. Three consequences the build depends on: ONE bad component fails
  the WHOLE `AddAppComponents` call (zero rows), so an unresolvable table **HALTS** the build naming it
  rather than shipping an app whose nav points at content it lacks; `AddAppComponents` does NOT
  de-duplicate (N components → N rows); and because a 204 says only that the request was *accepted*,
  the SDK **reads the components back** and asserts each declared table has a `componenttype: 1` row
  carrying that table's MetadataId, failing closed on an inconclusive read. That last point is the
  general rule this bug taught: **assert what you PRODUCED, not what you intended** — "some table
  component exists" was true of the corrupt apps too, and `ValidateApp` reported success on them.
  Pinned by `scripts/tests/app-entity-components-real-bundle.test.js`.
  The same rule binds **tests and evals**, with a distinction that is easy to get backwards:
  an EXPECTATION must come from the CONTRACT, independent of the code under test, while the FIXTURE
  that stands in for the environment should be generated from the builder's real output so it cannot
  drift from what ships. `smoke-eval.js` got both wrong at once: it asserted a `VectorIcon` the
  builder deliberately drops, and its unit test hand-wrote sitemap XML containing that value — so the
  offline suite stayed green while every live run failed. Deriving the expectation from `appDef`
  instead is the opposite failure and is just as bad: when the builder stops emitting a value, a
  derived "must be present" check silently becomes "must be absent" and still passes, leaving the
  eval unable to contradict the very code it exists to check. Assertions are therefore fixed by
  contract, the offline fixture is rendered from `appDef`, and `vendor-sdk-smoke.test.js` checks the
  bytes the real vendored SDK serializes.
- **`scripts/teardown-model-app.js` → `scripts/lib/sdk-teardown.js`** — the first-class, **classifier-safe**
  teardown (reverse of the build), for cleaning up live-verification probes or a failed build. Deletes
  exactly the artifacts a given App Spec declares, in dependency-safe order (**app module → security
  roles → dashboards → command bars → business rules → business process flows → forms → charts → views
  → reset enriched default views to drop
  parent lookups → relationships → AI row summaries → tables [reverse-topological, children-first] →
  web resources (generated app icon + page manifest + declared) → global choices → solution**). Forms/charts/views/relationships
  are deleted **explicitly before tables** (a table delete does not reliably cascade cross-references; it
  does remove the table's own columns). A business rule and a business process flow are `workflows` rows
  bound to the entity, so they too are deleted before their table — and each is **deactivated first**,
  because Dataverse refuses to delete an activated process. Deleting an activated BPF is also what
  removes the org-owned **backing table** the platform creates on activation. **Web resources are deleted after tables**: a table's vector/raster
  **icon** web resource is referenced by the table itself, so Dataverse refuses to delete it until the table
  is gone (form JS, referenced by its already-deleted form, is safe either way). Teardown also removes the
  build's **generated default app icon** (`<appUnique>_icon`, created in-solution when the spec sets no
  `app.icon`) so it doesn't leak as an orphan. **An app is TWO rows** — an `appmodule` AND a `sitemaps`
  row, with no lookup between them and no server-side cascade; the only link is
  `sitemap.sitemapnameunique === appmodule.uniquename`. Deleting only the appmodule strands the sitemap
  forever and, because `sitemapnameunique` is unique-constrained, permanently **burns that unique name**:
  a later build of an app with the same name fails with *"The name &lt;x&gt; is already in use by an
  existing site map"*, which the maker cannot act on. `deleteAppCascade` therefore resolves the sitemap
  BEFORE deleting the app, deletes both rows in **one atomic OData `$batch`**, and **fails closed** — any
  delete it cannot prove is rejected rather than guessed. This is why
  **`scripts/lib/sdk-http-client.js` must implement `postRaw`**: the SDK will not fall back to two
  sequential deletes, so a transport without it fails every teardown with `APP_DELETE_NOT_ATOMIC` (see
  that file for the wire contract and why a `$batch` is never retried). Pinned by
  `scripts/tests/app-delete-real-bundle.test.js` against the real bundle — every other teardown test
  drives a mock and would stay green through a regression here.
  The empty solution container goes last — but a **built-in
  system solution** (`Active`/`Default`/`Basic`) is **skipped** (Dataverse 400s any delete of a restricted
  solution), so a downloaded spec whose real solution could not be recovered (and defaulted to `Default`)
  still tears down cleanly instead of erroring. Command teardown
  removes the whole command bar for an entity the spec authored commands on (the SDK models a command bar
  per entity, not per button). Every id is resolved from a spec-declared name/logical/uniquename via an
  exact-match OData filter, so it can never wildcard-scan an org. **Dry-run by default** (`--apply`
  writes); best-effort continue (a failed step is recorded, teardown proceeds). A not-found (already-gone)
  error is treated as deleted, the table delete's **not-found-on-success** is tolerated (`tolerateNotFound`),
  and system/managed artifacts that cannot be deleted are recorded as `skipped` rather than failing.
  `--clear-workspace` prunes `.maker-workspace/` after a clean apply. `planTeardown(spec)` is pure (dry-run +
  unit-test surface); reuses `appUniqueName`/`commandsByEntity`/`topoOrderEntities` from the build engine (DRY).
- **`scripts/download-model-app.js` → `scripts/lib/hydrate-spec.js`** — the **edit flow**: pulls a
  *deployed* app back into an editable App Spec + page code (sitemap → `appShell` with icons, **every**
  generative page via `pac model genpage download`, referenced entities/tables, icon web resources,
  dashboards, solution).
  **Round-trip scope (be precise — do not claim "complete"):** tables, sitemap/appShell, generative pages,
  classic dashboards, icons, and solution round-trip; **forms, views, charts, and commands do NOT yet
  round-trip.** (View hydration was tried and reverted — LIVE-verified that the deployed savedquery set
  can't reliably tell app-builder-authored views from Dataverse's auto-generated Active/Inactive/QuickFind
  system views: `isdefault` is TRUE on the authored primary view and FALSE on the system Inactive view, so
  no filter isolates author views. Forms/charts/commands need structured reads the SDK doesn't expose.)
  All four survive on the live app (a rebuild preserves them by discovery), but are absent from the
  downloaded spec, so edit them in Maker or a fresh spec.
  **Entities are the sitemap's tables UNIONED with the entities owned by the app's VIEW / CHART /
  FORM components** (`appComponentEntities`) — a maker-built app can include tables reachable only via
  a lookup/sub-grid/related view, with no sitemap entry of their own, and reconstructing from the
  sitemap alone drops them. Note `componenttype eq 1` (Entities) rows are deliberately NOT used, but
  the REASON changed: apps built before the entity-component fix carry junk rows that all share one
  `objectid` (the `entity` metadata table's own id), so on those apps the row identifies the
  component *kind*, not which table. Newly built apps now carry CORRECT per-table objectids (see the
  build note below), so reading them is viable — it is not done yet because a legacy app's junk rows
  would resolve to the table literally named `entity` and have to be filtered.
  **Scope caveat:** `/app-builder` itself never creates a hidden component — a table
  with no sitemap subarea does not become an app component at all (LIVE-verified: declaring `task` in
  `entities[]` without nav left the app's component set unchanged), so for an app-builder-built app
  the sitemap set already IS the complete set. This union therefore only adds tables for apps built
  or edited in the maker. **Download does not recover an entity component that has no sitemap subarea**
  (ADO 6603388), and a live attempt to construct the hidden component it describes did not succeed:
  pinning `task` via `AddAppComponents` with the
  now-correct reference shape returned 204 but wrote no row, before or after publish. So the
  download-side fix cannot currently be verified end to end — do not implement it speculatively.
  The component read is best-effort: a failure degrades
  to the sitemap-derived set rather than failing the download. Each entity's **`primaryAttribute` comes from
  real Dataverse metadata** (`primaryNameAttribute`) and is **never synthesized**. The old
  `<entity>_name` guess was wrong for most OOB tables (`account` → `name`,
  `contact` → `fullname`) while looking plausible on custom ones, which is why it went unnoticed.
  Because validation *requires* `primaryAttribute`, a table without one cannot simply be emitted: a
  **sitemap** table missing it FAILS the download (actionable — the user asked for that table), while a
  **component-only** table missing it is dropped with a warning (it arrived via a best-effort read and
  was absent from the spec entirely before this change, so aborting over it would regress a previously
  working download with no override flag).
  The **solution** is recovered as the app's one *real* unmanaged solution — `recoverAppSolution` enumerates
  the app's solution memberships and excludes the built-in `Active`/`Default`/`Basic` system solutions the
  app is also a member of (see `scripts/lib/system-solutions.js`), so the downloaded spec can cleanly tear
  down its own solution instead of targeting the restricted `Default`. Its **publisher prefix is read from
  that solution's owning publisher** via the SDK's `getSolution` — NOT inferred from the app's uniquename,
  which is silent-wrong whenever the app name doesn't encode the publisher (an app named
  `new_customermanagement` inside publisher `contoso`, an app with no prefix, or a prefix longer than the
  guess assumed all collapsed to a literal `new`). The app-derived value remains the fallback, and
  `prefixResolved` is true for BOTH trusted sources — it gates the icon own-vs-foreign classification, so
  a downgrade there silently stops custom nav icons from round-tripping. Recovered **tables are flagged
  `existing: true`**, so a teardown of a downloaded spec never deletes a table (+ its data) this build
  cannot prove it created — download can't distinguish app-created from merely-referenced tables, so it
  fails safe (an orphaned table is recoverable; deleted customer data is not).
  Edit the downloaded spec and re-run the build (idempotent) — create and edit share one path. Always
  pull fresh at the start of an edit session (the build reads an etag; a write against an artifact
  changed in Maker throws a version conflict → re-pull, never clobber). **Classic DashBoard subareas
  round-trip** too — `readDashboards` reconstructs each into `dashboards[]` with **id-passthrough tiles**
  (every tile carries the deployed view/chart ids), so a rebuild recreates the dashboard against the
  existing views/charts without re-declaring them (genpage/entity/URL subareas round-trip losslessly). A
  dashboard whose tiles cannot be reconstructed is dropped and surfaced in `droppedSubareas`.
  **A URL subarea that TARGETS a web resource round-trips too.** The Site Map Designer's "custom page
  backed by an HTML web resource" writes `$webresource:<name>` (Dataverse also serves it at
  `/WebResources/<name>`) into a URL subarea. Passing that token through used to fail the WHOLE
  download on validation — the http(s) guard rejected it — so no spec was written at all and download
  → edit → rebuild was blocked for the entire app over one nav entry (issue #430). The reference now
  **passes validation as-is**, exactly like a platform icon ref and for the reason recorded there: it
  is a live/OOB value a downloaded app carries, and rejecting it broke the round-trip on real apps.
  Requiring it to be *declared* would re-make that mistake, because such a page is frequently managed
  or owned by another publisher.
  Download additionally captures the page's CONTENT when it can safely do so. `collectSitemap` returns
  these as **`navRefs`, separate from icon `customRefs`**, because the type policy differs: the icon
  path gates on `IMAGE_WR_TYPES` by design and such a page is `html` (type 1), so routing it through
  the icon rules silently declared nothing and left a rebuild pointing at a resource the spec could
  not recreate. A nav ref takes the same safety gates as an icon — own prefix, unmanaged, has content,
  `external: true` so teardown never deletes it — minus the image-type gate. A managed/foreign one is
  left as a bare reference (it exists in the target env). The build needed no change: it already
  passes a subarea `url` straight through to the sitemap.
  This does **not** weaken the http(s) guard, which exists to stop an *arbitrary* scheme
  (`javascript:`, `file:`) becoming a nav entry in a shipped app — a web-resource reference names a
  resource inside Dataverse, not a script or a local file. A genuinely unexpressible url is still
  dropped and counted in `droppedSubareas`.
- **`scripts/verify-model-app.js` → `scripts/lib/verify-spec.js`** — read-only reconcile of the App Spec
  against what actually deployed; exits non-zero and lists anything missing, catching silent partial
  builds. Checks **existence** (entities/columns/views/charts/forms + sitemap subareas + icons + pages by
  id) AND, best-effort, **content** so an *unapplied edit* is caught (not just a missing artifact): a
  view's **column set** (parsed from `layoutxml` — the additive `reconcileView` won't drop a removed spec
  column, so this flags it), plus **relationship** and **command-bar existence** (previously unchecked).
  Content checks are additive + reader-gated (they only fire when the reader supplies `layoutxml` /
  `entityRelationships` / `commandBar`), so existence-only callers are unaffected. It also reconciles
  **AI app features**: for every `ai.appFeatures` entry it proves an APP-SCOPE OVERRIDE ROW exists in
  `appsettings` holding the requested value. Verify previously had no awareness of `spec.ai` at all, so
  a run whose every AI feature was skipped (admin gate off) or silently not persisted still reported a
  clean PASS. The oracle is deliberately the override row and NOT the effective value:
  `RetrieveSetting(name, { appUniqueName })` **falls back to the environment value** when the app has no
  override, so an effective-value compare passes whenever the environment already holds the requested
  value — a false PASS for an app that was never configured, and the same oracle the SDK uses for its
  `applied` bucket. It fails CLOSED when the proof cannot be read, and the check needs BOTH
  `retrieveSetting` and `queryRecords` on the reader (an existence-only reader skips it rather than
  degrading to the unsound compare). Note the per-app settings are DISTINCT from the org readiness gates —
  `nlSearch`'s gate is the boolean `EnableNLGridSearch` but its per-app setting is the numeric
  `NLGridSearchSetting`; conflating them is what let NL grid search report "applied" while writing
  nothing. This is the F5 "convergence" mitigation: the build is additive (edits to existing artifacts
  aren't re-applied in place — teardown + rebuild to converge), and verify makes any resulting
  divergence **loud**.
- **`scripts/ai-preflight.js`** — standalone preflight report: prints each AI feature's on/off status
  and the exact admin action needed (Power Platform Admin Center → Environments → Settings → Product →
  Features) for anything off. Never fails. The `ai-features` build phase calls this logic internally and
  uses `RetrieveSetting`/`SaveSettingValue` (SDK) for app-level feature flags and `AIModelPublish` +
  `aiskillconfigs` for per-table row summaries. Feature values are `true`/`false` (the numeric settings'
  1/0) or an explicit integer such as `2` ("on for everyone"), bounded to `0..1000000` — the same range
  the SDK enforces, so validation rejects an out-of-range value up front instead of aborting the build
  half-applied. The SDK **proves every write** against the app-scope override row, retrying with backoff
  (an immediate read can still return the environment fallback, which previously produced a false
  `notPersisted` on first apply). `applied` is the ONLY success bucket; a feature otherwise lands in
  `skipped` (org gate off), `notPersisted` (no override observed for the whole retry budget — Dataverse
  can accept an app-scope `SaveSettingValue` with HTTP 204 and store nothing), `unverified` (the write
  was issued but the proof could not be read) or `failed` (the write threw; the rest of the batch still
  reports). The build surfaces **every** non-success bucket as a `⊘` warning plus in the phase detail
  — buckets are read off the result object, so one a future SDK adds is reported verbatim rather than
  silently dropped — and `--verify` fails on any of them. **An app-scope setting WRITE is a no-op until
  the app is published** (live-measured: the write reports `notPersisted` and `appsettings` holds no row
  at all, while publishing and re-issuing the same call applies every feature). This is not read lag, so
  re-*proving* after publish cannot fix it — the build **re-issues** the write after publish for anything
  the first attempt did not apply. Verification proves the override ROW, keyed by `appmoduleid`, so the
  build passes the id it already holds rather than have the SDK resolve it by name (an unpublished
  appmodule is not readable). See the `ai-features` phase in `scripts/lib/sdk-build.js` for the full
  sequence and its bounds.
  The flag set is resolved ONCE by `scripts/lib/ai-app-settings.js` and shared by the build and the
  verifier: a spec with an `ai` block but no `ai.appFeatures` still gets defaults written, so
  reconciling only the DECLARED features left them applied-but-unverified.
  All AI features are **admin-gated**: the skill preflights
  and skips/warns; it cannot flip admin or tenant switches. `scripts/lib/ai-candidates.js` selects
  good-candidate tables for auto row-summary mode; `scripts/lib/ai-prompt.js` generates tailored summary
  prompts. The `ai` block in the App Spec configures the full set; see
  [`references/app-spec-schema.md`](references/app-spec-schema.md) → `## ai`.
- **`scripts/preview-form.js` → `scripts/lib/form-preview.js`** — renders an ASCII **form
  wireframe** (tabs, sections, fields with widget hints, the Notes/timeline block, sub-grids, form
  JS) from the App Spec, so the user can review a form visually during authoring before approving.
  **`scripts/preview-app.js` → `scripts/lib/app-preview.js`** — renders the WHOLE app design
  (data model + sitemap tree + views/charts + per-form wireframes + page-intents + design contract)
  as a single ASCII preview — the design gate #2 / plan-mode approval artifact.
  **`scripts/write-app-spec-doc.js` → `scripts/lib/app-spec-doc.js`** — renders `model-app-plan.md`,
  the durable **Markdown design document** the user reviews and keeps alongside the app (jobs →
  surfaces traceability, data model, every surface incl. generative pages, navigation, the access
  model per role, sample data, design contract, AI features). Distinct from `app-preview.js`: that is
  an ASCII console preview for the in-conversation approval gate, this is durable Markdown for review
  and archival. It is **rendered, never hand-written** — the freehand version drifted from the spec
  and shrank to a counts summary. Also returns `warnings[]` naming design gaps (no jobs captured, a
  job with no covering surface, no generative pages) so the orchestrator surfaces them in chat.
- **`scripts/vendor/cds-maker-sdk.cjs`** — the SDK vendored as a self-contained headless bundle
  (rebuild via `scripts/_vendor-build/`); **`scripts/lib/sdk-http-client.js`** injects an
  `az`-token HttpClient. No browser, no relay — the SDK reuses the designer's own serializers.
- The build log is **phase-grouped with per-step status** (`▶ phase` / `[n/total] ✓ created` /
  `⊘ skipped` / `✗ failed`) + a closing summary; dry-run lists the same plan with a `▢` marker.

The end-to-end flow (Phase 0 working dir → Phase 1 author **in the main loop** per
`references/authoring-flow.md` → Phase 2 narrated SDK build → Phase 3 verify & iterate; **edit** an
existing app via the same path — `download-model-app.js` pulls it back into a spec, then re-run Phase 2
idempotently) is diagrammed in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) → *`/app-builder` —
build pipeline*. **Upcoming:** shippable-defaults provisioning (security role / standard views; the
quick-create table flag now ships via `entities[].quickCreate` / an authored `QuickCreate` form —
auto-generating the Quick Create form's field layout is the remaining follow-up).

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/genpage` | Build and deploy generative pages for a model-driven Power App |
| `/app-builder` | **(Preview)** Build and edit a whole model-driven app — tables, columns, relationships, adaptive forms, views, Choice-column charts, generative pages, app + sitemap, sample data, and admin-gated AI features — from a natural-language intent, via the vendored `cds-maker-sdk` |
| `/report-issue` | File a bug/issue about the model-apps plugin to the GitHub repository |
| `/telemetry` | Enable, disable, or check usage telemetry (`on \| off \| status`) |

## Agents

Agents are invoked by skills via the `Task` tool — they are not user-invocable.

| Agent | Invoked By | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `genpage-planner` | `genpage` (create flow) | Validates prereqs, gathers requirements, detects entity/app existence, presents plan for approval, writes `genpage-plan.md` |
| `genpage-entity-builder` | `genpage` (create flow) | Provisions Dataverse tables, columns, relationships, choices, and sample data via `scripts/provision-entities.js` (the shared SDK-backed core). Bulk inserts use OData `$batch`. Writes a transactional log for recovery |
| `genpage-page-builder` | `genpage` (create flow) **and** `app-builder` (Phase 1.5) | Generates one complete `.tsx` page from a plan document and schema; runs in parallel with other builders for multi-page requests. `/app-builder` projects its App Spec into that plan format via `scripts/write-page-plan.js` and dispatches this same agent |
| `genpage-edit-planner` | `genpage` (edit flow) | Reads the downloaded page artifacts (page.tsx, config.json, prompt.txt), gathers change requirements, presents edit plan, writes `genpage-edit-plan.md`. The orchestrator applies the edit inline. |
| `genpage-connector-builder` | `genpage` orchestrator (create **and** edit flows) | **Single owner of the connectors feature gate.** Performs connector discovery (connections, connection references, datasets, tables, operations, schema), creates Dataverse connection references, and writes the `## Connector Bindings` contract + `connectors.json`. The orchestrator forwards its output into the planner or edit-planner prompt. |
| `genpage-customapi-builder` | `genpage` orchestrator (create **and** edit flows) | **Single owner of the custom-api feature gate.** Discovers the Dataverse Custom APIs a page can bind to (Global + entity-bound Actions/Functions) plus their parameter kinds via `list-custom-apis.js`, and writes the `## Custom API Bindings` contract + `actions.json`. The orchestrator forwards its output into the planner or edit-planner prompt. |

## Key Concepts

### Genux Pages

Generative pages (genux) are React 17 + TypeScript single-file components that run inside model-driven Power Apps. They use Fluent UI V9 for styling and the DataAPI for Dataverse data access. Each page is a single `.tsx` file with `export default GeneratedComponent`.

### DataAPI

The DataAPI (`props.dataApi`) provides typed CRUD operations against Dataverse tables. It uses RuntimeTypes.ts (generated by `pac model genpage generate-types`) for type safety. Column names must be verified from the generated schema — never guessed.

### RuntimeTypes

TypeScript type definitions generated from Dataverse metadata. Contains entity types, enum registrations, and the `GeneratedComponentProps` interface. Generated via PAC CLI before code generation to ensure correct column names.

## Feature Flags

Unreleased functionality is gated behind committed, **default-OFF** feature flags so
the skill can merge ahead of its cross-repo dependencies. With a flag OFF, the
**deployed page behavior is identical to before the feature existed** — the guarantee
is about runtime/deploy output, not that every authoring artifact is byte-for-byte
unchanged (e.g. plans still carry a `## Connector Bindings: No connector bindings.`
line). The mechanism lives in `scripts/lib/feature-flags.js` with the committed
values in `feature-flags.json` at the plugin root.

- **Source of truth:** `feature-flags.json` (e.g. `{ "connectors": false }`). Flip a
  flag to `true` in a one-line PR once its dependencies are GA in PROD.
- **Precedence (highest first):** env var `GENPAGE_ENABLE_<FLAG>` (e.g.
  `GENPAGE_ENABLE_CONNECTORS=1`) → committed `feature-flags.json` → default `false`
  (fail-closed). This mirrors the telemetry opt-out env-over-config convention.
- **LLM gate:** skill/agent markdown probes a flag with
  `node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/feature-flags.js" <flag>` (prints `enabled`/`disabled`,
  exits 0/1) and skips the gated workflow when disabled. `--list` prints every known
  flag's lifecycle **status** (experimental / in-progress / ga), effective state +
  source (env/file/default), summary, how to enable, plus config-validation warnings.
  Flags are catalogued with that metadata in the `FLAGS` map in `feature-flags.js`
  (the committed `feature-flags.json` carries only the on/off value).
- **Script backstop:** connector entrypoints call the shared
  `exitIfConnectorsDisabled()` helper (DRY — no inlined gate) and fail closed with
  exit 3 when OFF: `list-connections.js`, `create-connection-reference.js`, and the
  `--connection-refs` branch of `add-page-to-solution.js`. Custom API entrypoints call
  the parallel `exitIfCustomApiDisabled()` helper the same way: `list-custom-apis.js`.
- **Validation:** `KNOWN_FLAGS` + `validateFlags()` warn on unknown keys / non-boolean
  values in the committed file (so a typo can't silently do nothing, or — after a flip
  to `true` — accidentally enable the wrong thing).

**Each gated feature has a SINGLE OWNER agent, and every entry point must go through it or the
shared helper.** Both currently-gated features gate at the same five places, so the rule is stated
once here and only the per-feature specifics are tabled below:

1. **Discovery** — the owner agent runs the probe first; planners/edit-planners delegate to it and
   never gate inline.
2. **Scripts** — each entry-point script calls the shared `exitIf<Feature>Disabled()` helper (DRY —
   never an inlined gate) and fails closed with exit 3 when OFF.
3. **Deploy** — the SKILL phase **re-probes** the flag and treats an absent/malformed bindings
   section as *no bindings*, so a plan authored while the flag was ON cannot deploy after it goes OFF.
4. **ALM** — solution packaging honours the flag (or documents why it needs no gate).
5. **Codegen** — `genpage-page-builder` emits feature code **only** when the plan carries an actual
   binding table, never on an absent/sentinel section.

| | `connectors` | `custom-api` | `custom-telemetry` |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Owner agent** | `genpage-connector-builder` | `genpage-customapi-builder` | none — codegen-only |
| **Plan section** | `## Connector Bindings` | `## Custom API Bindings` | none — driven by the maker request, not the plan |
| **Gated scripts** | `list-connections.js`, `create-connection-reference.js` | `list-custom-apis.js` | none |
| **Deploy phase** | SKILL Phase 4.5 | SKILL Phase 4.6 | SKILL Phase 4.7 (probe only) |
| **ALM** | the `--connection-refs` branch of `add-page-to-solution.js` | none needed — `config.json`'s `actionBindings` travels inside the page's `uxagentprojectfile` rows automatically (the Custom APIs themselves are a separate deployment prerequisite, bound by name) | none — telemetry rides the host runtime, nothing is packaged |
| **Emits** | connector code | `executeAction` / `executeFunction` / `listBoundActions` | `props.appInsights` calls (`trackEvent` / `trackMetric` / `trackTrace` / `trackException` / `trackDependency` / `startTrack` / `stopTrack`) |

One connectors-only nuance: at Phase 4.5 the `/genpage` orchestrator re-probes and passes the
verbatim result as `Connectors: enabled|disabled` in every page-builder dispatch — **that dispatch
value wins over the plan's `## Connector Bindings` section.** Phase 4.7 does the same for
`Telemetry: enabled|disabled`.

`custom-telemetry` is the odd one out: it has no owner agent, no discovery script, no plan
section and no deploy or ALM step. It gates **code generation only** — steps 2-4 of the
checklist above are N/A, and its Phase 4.7 "deploy phase" is nothing but the re-probe that
produces the dispatch line. It also carries a second gate the other flags do not have: even
when `enabled`, `genpage-page-builder` instruments a page **only** when the maker explicitly
asked to measure or track something. `enabled` is permission, not instruction.

All three flags currently ship **OFF**, each waiting on cross-repo dependencies:

- **`connectors`** — the pac CLI connector verbs (PowerPlatform-Scale-AdminTools), the GenUX
  authoring control (power-platform-ux), and the maker/admin ECS setting must all release first.
- **`custom-api`** — the AIBuilder CoderAgent action prompt, the shared `pai-gen-ux-action-runtime`
  plus the UCI and Controls host runtimes, a pac CLI `model genpage upload --actions` verb to
  persist `actionBindings` into `config.json`, and the `GenUxPluginActionAllowList` ECS setting.
  Note the maker-facing name is "Custom API" while the shipped wire contract stays
  `actionBindings` / `executeAction` (see `references/custom-api.md`).
- **`custom-telemetry`** — the page telemetry facade in the UCI host runtime, the GenUX
  authoring control (power-platform-ux), the AIBuilder CoderAgent telemetry prompt, and the
  `GenUxEnableCustomTelemetry` ECS setting (see `references/page-telemetry.md`).

## TSX source lexer — known limits

**`scripts/lib/source-literals.js` — known limits.** It is a hand-rolled TSX lexer, not a
parser: the plugin ships dependency-free, so there is no TypeScript to call. It tracks
code / line comment / block comment / string / template / regex / JSX tag / JSX text, and
backs the `promote-intent-pages.js` structural gate plus the eval's effect scoper.

Judge changes to it by **both** error directions, and weight them correctly:
- a false **accept** promotes prose as a page, and promotion is sticky — the page is then
  marked implemented and skipped on retry;
- a false **reject** blocks a real user mid-build, which is worse, because their page was
  fine.

`scripts/tests/source-literals.test.js` carries a **false-positive corpus** over every
committed `.tsx` in `samples/` and `evals/model-apps/genpage/fixtures/` (enumerated via
`git ls-files`, so it does not race the transient fixture dirs `capture-fixture.test.js`
creates). Two lexer bugs were invisible to hand-written cases and caught only by that
corpus — keep it, and add to it rather than around it.

Residual limits, accepted deliberately:
- **`<` disambiguation is structural, not semantic.** A generic arrow is recognised by its
  shape — type parameters, then a balanced `(…)`, then `=>` (optionally via a return-type
  annotation). Exotic shapes that break the shape rule (e.g. a type-parameter *default*
  containing an unmatched `)`) can still be misread.
- **Lookahead is bounded** (`LOOKAHEAD`, 2000 chars) so a stray `<` cannot walk the file. A
  signature longer than that is not recognised as a generic.

Neither shape occurs in the corpus, and both fail *loudly* (exit 3, retryable) rather than
silently. If you hit one, widen the tests first.

## Hooks & Validators

Hooks are registered centrally in `hooks/hooks.json` (auto-loaded by the plugin
host). Validators **fail open** on any internal error (exit 0). The icon validator
blocks only on a real generated-page violation (exit 2); the write-safety guard is
non-blocking by design (exit 1), so hook bugs do not break `/genpage` or
`/app-builder` authoring.

- **PostToolUse(Skill)** — `run-skill-posttool-validation.js` runs a skill's
  `skills/<skill>/scripts/validate*.js` when present. Tracked skills are discovered
  from `skills/*/SKILL.md` by `scripts/lib/modelapps-hook-utils.js`, so both
  `/genpage` and `/app-builder` are tracked automatically (the telemetry control
  skill is excluded from tracking).
- **PostToolUse(Write|Edit|MultiEdit)** — `validate-icon-imports.js` validates
  `@fluentui/react-icons` named imports in generated `.tsx` pages against
  `references/verified-icons.txt`, automating the page-builder's manual grep. It is
  gated to generated-page output (the file's `export default GeneratedComponent`
  marker) or plugin-specific sibling markers (`genpage-plan.md` or
  `model-app-plan.md`). It intentionally does **not** use `app-spec.json` as a
  sibling marker because this validator blocks (exit 2) and `app-spec.json` is too
  generic for a globally installed hook.
- **PreToolUse(Write|Edit|MultiEdit)** — `validate-write-safety.js` **flags
  (non-blocking, exit 1)** writes outside the cwd, and only during an active
  model-apps authoring session (`genpage-plan.md`, `model-app-plan.md`, or
  `app-spec.json` at/under cwd). It accepts `app-spec.json` because a false
  positive only warns; it never blocks and is a clean no-op in unrelated projects.
  Silence with `MODEL_APPS_SKIP_WRITE_GUARD=1`.
- **Master kill-switch** — `MODEL_APPS_DISABLE_HOOKS=1` (or `true`) disables **all**
  model-apps hooks (validators + telemetry emit); checked before any stdin/work.
  Both escape hatches are documented in `README.md`.

## Telemetry

This plugin ships 1DS telemetry for `skill_started`. The canonical library is the
repo-root `shared/telemetry/`; `scripts/lib/telemetry/lib` is a **physical copy**
(never a symlink) so installed plugins don't depend on symlink handling. Edit
`shared/telemetry/lib/` first, then refresh this plugin's copy in the same change.

- **Posture:** the committed `ikey.json` ships **`disabled: true`** (Tier-1 static,
  no resolver) — currently carrying the **provisioned model-apps key + collector +
  `event_stream_name`, staged disabled**. It emits nothing — no POST, no local log —
  while `disabled: true`; flip `disabled` to `false` only after the Geneva mapping
  is validated in DGrep (see the ADE provisioning runbook). `disabled: true` is the
  active guard; the placeholder-key gate is a secondary defense for un-provisioned
  copies. **Provision a fresh key; never copy another plugin's `ikey.json`**
  (CI-enforced: `node scripts/validate-telemetry-ikeys.js`).
- **Emission:** `hooks/run-skill-pretool-telemetry.js` (PreToolUse Skill) and
  `hooks/run-user-prompt-telemetry.js` (UserPromptSubmit `/model-apps:<skill>`).
- **Privacy:** default-on usage telemetry. Events include Dataverse organization
  and Entra tenant GUIDs when PAC is signed in, but Model Apps excludes the
  signed-in user's Entra object ID. The local diagnostic mirror retains the same
  event fields. Users opt out of transmission via
  `/model-apps:telemetry off`; the local diagnostic mirror
  (`~/.power-platform-skills/telemetry/model-apps/sessions/<id>/events.jsonl`) is
  still written. CI/automation opt out via
  `POWER_PLATFORM_SKILLS_TELEMETRY_MODEL_APPS_OPTOUT=1` (highest precedence).
- **Fail closed:** telemetry never changes a script's exit code; emission is
  fire-and-forget via a detached dispatcher child. See `shared/telemetry/README.md`.

## Development Standards

- **React 17 + TypeScript** — all generated code
- **Fluent UI V9** — `@fluentui/react-components` exclusively (DatePicker from `@fluentui/react-datepicker-compat`, TimePicker from `@fluentui/react-timepicker-compat`)
- **Single file architecture** — all components, utilities, styles in one `.tsx` file
- **No external libraries** — only React, Fluent UI V9, approved Fluent icons, D3.js for charts
- **Type-safe DataAPI** — use RuntimeTypes when Dataverse entities are involved
- **Responsive design** — flexbox, relative units, never `100vh`/`100vw`
- **Accessibility** — WCAG AA, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML
- **Complete code** — no placeholders, TODOs, or ellipses in final output

## Dataverse Access From Scripts

**Default: go through the vendored SDK.** Anything the SDK models — tables, columns, relationships,
views, charts, forms, commands, dashboards, app modules, sitemaps, solutions, roles, settings — is
read and written through `createMakerSdk`. That is not style: the SDK persists metadata under
`<app-folder>/.maker-workspace/` for reuse and edits, resolves artifact identity the same way the
build does, and owns retry/pagination behaviour. A read that bypasses it can disagree with the write
about which artifact it is talking about.

Two escape hatches exist, and both are deliberate. The maker SDK models the *maker* surface; parts of
Dataverse simply are not in it.

| Hatch | Use for | Examples in tree |
|---|---|---|
| `dataverseRequest()` in `lib/dataverse-auth.js` (and the `dataverse-request.js` CLI) | Dataverse surfaces the SDK does not model at all | `WhoAmI` (`check-auth.js`), `customapis` (`list-custom-apis.js`), `connectionreferences` (`create-connection-reference.js`), solution-component adds (`add-page-to-solution.js`) |
| The raw `httpClient` from `createAzHttpClient` | A surface the SDK *does* touch but whose response it **projects away** | `entityPrivileges` in `verify-model-app.js` — `fetchEntityMetadata` returns `{logicalName, displayName, entitySetName, attributes, relationships}` and drops `Privileges` entirely. The projection's omission is permanent (it is disk-cached and best-effort, the wrong contract for a security read) and pinned by an SDK guardrail test. **Transitional:** the SDK is gaining a dedicated `getEntityPrivileges()`; switch to it and drop this raw read once the vendored bundle carries it |

**Prefer `dataverseRequest()` over the raw client.** It already handles the API path, auth, headers
and timeouts. Reach for `httpClient` only when you must share the exact client instance the SDK is
using, as the verify reader does.

When you do go direct, all four of these apply:

1. **Comment WHY the SDK cannot serve it** — name the SDK method you would otherwise call and what it
   drops or lacks. "Deliberately not `sdk.fetchEntityMetadata`" is the difference between a
   documented exception and something a later reader "simplifies" back into a silent bug.
2. **Absolute URL including `/api/data/v9.2`** when using the raw `httpClient`. It is the transport
   the SDK drives, so it takes full request URLs and validates them with `new URL(url)` for its
   same-origin guard — a relative path throws there rather than resolving against the org.
3. **GUIDs unquoted.** Record ids and `_x_value` lookups are `Edm.Guid`; `id eq '<guid>'` fails with
   *"A binary operator with incompatible types was detected"*. See `references/troubleshooting.md`.
4. **Test the reader itself, not only an injected stub.** The `entityPrivileges` URL bug shipped
   because every test injected a fake reader into `verifySpec`, so the real one was never executed —
   and `verify-spec` catches per-entity read failures, so it would have failed silently on every live
   run rather than crashing. Drive at least one test through the real client's request seam.


- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines
- Use short, descriptive `name` field (e.g., `genpage`)
- Write descriptions in third person ("Creates X" not "This skill guides you through creating X")
- Use progressive disclosure: SKILL.md for workflow, reference files for details
- Link to references inline: `See [troubleshooting.md](../../references/troubleshooting.md)`
- Immediately after the frontmatter of every user-invocable skill, run
  `node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/check-version.js"` and show any output before
  proceeding. The check is best-effort and must never block skill execution.

## Building & Testing

**One-command regression gate (run before every commit)** — from `plugins/model-apps/`:

```bash
# Plugin unit suite only (node:test):
node scripts/run-tests.js

# Plugin suite + the vendored SDK's Jest suite (Node 20):
NODE20_BIN=/path/to/node20/bin node scripts/run-tests.js --with-sdk /path/to/power-platform-ux
```

- `run-tests.js` runs the full `scripts/tests/*.test.js` suite and prints a combined PASS/FAIL.
  **CI runs this same command** (`.github/workflows/model-apps-script-tests.yml`) on any PR touching
  `plugins/model-apps/**` or `evals/model-apps/**`, across ubuntu × windows × macos and Node 20 × 22.
  Keep `POWER_PLATFORM_SKILLS_TELEMETRY_MODEL_APPS_OPTOUT: "1"` on any new job that could run a
  telemetry-emitting hook or script.
- The SDK's Jest suite needs **Node 20** (its `canvas` native module is built for the Node-20 ABI).
  Set `NODE20_BIN` to a Node-20 bin dir; without it the SDK suite is skipped (plugin suite still runs).
- genpage evals: `node --test evals/model-apps/genpage/tests/*.test.js`, plus the Layer 1/2 runners
  (`node evals/model-apps/genpage/run-layer-{1,2}.js --tier smoke`). See `## Eval Suite` below.

**The vendored SDK lives in a separate repo.** The Dataverse mechanics are in
`power-platform-ux` (Azure DevOps `msazure/OneAgile`), package `packages/cds-maker-sdk`. This plugin
ships a **self-contained bundle** at `scripts/vendor/cds-maker-sdk.cjs` (NOT the SDK source). The SDK
owns deterministic wire formats (create/query/delete, AI settings/row-summaries, `seedRecordGraph`,
`enrichDefaultViews`, artifact resolve/cascade); the plugin owns judgment (spec validation, candidate
selection, prompt authoring). To change SDK behavior:

```bash
# 1. Build the SDK (emits lib/) — from <ppux>/packages/cds-maker-sdk:
npm run build          # tsc/ppux-build
npm test               # Jest (Node 20)
npm run lint           # ppux-lint (Node 20)

# 2. Rebuild the vendored bundle here (reads the SDK's lib/, so build the SDK first) — from repo root:
node plugins/model-apps/scripts/_vendor-build/build.js --sdk /path/to/power-platform-ux
# → rewrites scripts/vendor/cds-maker-sdk.cjs (~540 KB). COMMIT the rebuilt bundle.
```

Only the SDK `src/` is committed in the SDK repo (`lib/` is gitignored). A type-only/whitespace SDK
edit produces a byte-identical `lib/*.js`, so the bundle only needs rebuilding when SDK **runtime**
changes.

**Vendored-SDK contract invariants (regression net).** When you bump the SDK and re-vendor, the
skill relies on behaviors that must survive. Four test files lock them — run all against every
rebuilt bundle.

**Re-vendor from a COMMIT, and check the recorded provenance.** `scripts/_vendor-build/build.js`
writes `scripts/vendor/PROVENANCE.json` next to the bundle: the upstream SHA and subject, whether
that package had uncommitted changes, and the bundle's own sha256. Two things make this
load-bearing rather than bookkeeping. First, the bundler consumes the SDK's **gitignored `lib/`**,
a build output that can be arbitrarily older than `src/` — a bundle shipped in this repo was once
built from a stale `lib/` several commits behind its nominal source, and nothing could reveal it.
The bundler now **refuses** (exit 3) when `lib/index.js` predates the newest `.ts` under `src/`.
Second, "built from master" is not provenance, because master moves; the SHA is what lets a
reviewer reproduce the artifact. Re-running the build on the same inputs must reproduce the same
sha256 — check it.

`scripts/tests/sdk-surface-contract.test.js` — the **method-presence** guard. Asserts every SDK
method the engines call (`SKILL_SDK_SURFACE`, kept in sync with the `provision.*` / `sdk.*` call
sites by a source-scan test that also covers `artifact-intent.js`) is a function on the real vendored
bundle. A re-vendored SDK that **renames or removes** a method the skill uses fails HERE, listing the
exact names — instead of silently at build time (the mock-based `sdk-build`/`sdk-teardown` suites
can't catch that, since the mock mimics the old interface). The skill drives Dataverse through the
SDK's **generic** surface (`createArtifact`/`addElement`/`updateElement`/`removeElement`/`getArtifact`/
`fetchArtifact`/`pushArtifact`), NOT per-artifact mutators — a bundle that drops the generic surface
fails here. Update `SKILL_SDK_SURFACE` **and** migrate the call sites together.

`scripts/tests/hardening2-real-bundle.test.js` — **compiler↔adapter integration** against the real
bundle: it drives `artifact-intent.js` + the generic surface exactly as the engine does and asserts
the real wire output — **parity** with a pre-swap golden (`fixtures/parity-golden.json`, via the pure
`wire-facts.js` normalizer), multi-tab/section create, **metadata-derived control classIds** (a Lookup
and a String field get DIFFERENT classids — the adapter defaults them from attribute type, T4, so the
plugin must NOT precompute classId), sub-grid relationship/target/view serialization, `/bag/c` events
**merge** (exactly one `<events>` root on a rebuild), field removal, and the **412 → failed
`PushResult`** signal `requireSuccessfulPush` halts on. The mock-based `sdk-build.test.js` covers the
engine ORCHESTRATION (call order, idempotency, phase selection); this covers what a mock cannot.

`scripts/tests/vendor-sdk-smoke.test.js` — the **behavior/return-shape** `CONTRACT:` tests (drive the
public `createMakerSdk` factory — the `MakerSdk`/`AppAdapter` classes are no longer bundle exports):
- **Raw OData filters pass through, single-encoded** — the skill builds raw `$filter` strings
  (quoted string literals via `lib/odata.js`, and **unquoted GUID literals** like `objectid eq <guid>`);
  a query builder may transport-encode them but must not double-encode.
- **Name-based methods accept logical/unique/schema names verbatim** — `deleteTable`, `setEntityIcon`,
  `resolveArtifact({uniqueName}/{name}/{entity})`, `createRelationship({referencedEntity,…})`. A GUID
  normalizer must apply to GUID params ONLY, never to these names.
- **Sitemap free-text (titles/URLs/descriptions) is XML-escaped, not rejected** — a "safe DOM factory"
  must escape attribute/text VALUES while only validating element/attribute NAMES.
- **`deleteAppCascade` returns a structured `{ success, deleted, failures }` result** — teardown
  reads `failures` to report orphaned sitemap/genpage rows instead of claiming a clean delete; the
  bundle must keep returning the result (not void) after a re-vendor.
- **`seedRecordGraph` returns `{ createdIds: { <entityLogical>: [ids] } }`** and dedups only on an
  explicit **`matchOn`** key (it NEVER falls back to the primary display name — `buildSeedGroup`
  supplies `matchOn` from a single-column alternate key or the primary name, validated non-empty).

`scripts/tests/sdk-async-surface.test.js` — the **sync-vs-async** guard, and the one to read first
after a re-vendor. The SDK's generic surface is asynchronous (`addElement`, `findElements`,
`getArtifact`, `moveElement`, `queryTree`, `removeElement`, `updateElement` all return Promises; a
read may revalidate against the server before serving its cached copy). Forgetting an `await` does
**not** throw: a Promise is truthy, so the engine's `|| {}` fallbacks stay dormant and the pure
helpers silently receive a Promise — `hasSubgrid` → `false` (duplicate sub-grid), `formFieldLogicals`
→ `[]` (every field looks missing), `findFieldCellPointer` → `null` (a removal never happens). Wrong
artifacts, 2xx statuses, green build. The test therefore does two things: a **source scan** that
fails on any un-awaited `provision.*`/`sdk.*` call to those methods (annotate a deliberate one with
`sdk-async-ok`), and a **dynamic check** that the real bundle still returns Promises for exactly that
list — so if a future SDK makes one synchronous again, the scan can't go on enforcing a dead rule.


**Live end-to-end (app-builder — writes to a real Dataverse env; optional).** All build/verify/
teardown scripts are **dry-run by default**; add `--apply` to write.

```bash
az account set --subscription <sub-id>
node scripts/check-auth.js --env <envUrl>       # az token + WhoAmI preflight (pac optional; --require-pac for genpage)
node scripts/build-model-app.js   --env <envUrl> --spec @<dir>/app-spec.json [--sample-data --publish] --apply --verify
node scripts/verify-model-app.js  --env <envUrl> --spec @<dir>/app-spec.json
node scripts/teardown-model-app.js --env <envUrl> --spec @<dir>/app-spec.json --apply --allow-destructive
```

AI features are **admin-gated** — preflight readiness with `node scripts/ai-preflight.js --env <envUrl>`.
Prefer a scratch env; always tear down probes so nothing app-owned is left behind. Teardown needs
`--allow-destructive` as well as `--apply` — with `--apply` alone it refuses and exits — and it
deliberately leaves **one** thing behind: the **publisher**. A publisher can own other solutions in
the environment, so deleting it is not this app's decision to make — the same fail-safe reasoning
that keeps an `external` web resource. Expect a clean environment afterwards *except* for
`<prefix>publisher`; if a probe must restore the environment exactly, remove that row yourself after
confirming it owns no other solution.

**After modifying the plugin also:** run `claude --debug` to confirm the plugin loads, exercise the
skill (`/genpage` or `/app-builder`), and for genpage verify Playwright browser checks
(navigate/snapshot/click/screenshot).

**Hooks + telemetry:** the lifecycle hooks and telemetry hooks are covered by the plugin unit suite
(`node scripts/run-tests.js`). Keep `scripts/lib/telemetry/ikey.json` shipping `disabled: true` until a
key is provisioned (a test enforces this), and run `node scripts/validate-telemetry-ikeys.js` from the
repo root after touching `ikey.json`.

## Eval Suite

The plugin has a 3-layer eval suite under `evals/model-apps/genpage/`. Two
layers are automated (TAP v13 runners); Layer 3 is manual.

- **Comprehensive guide:** `evals/model-apps/genpage/EVAL_GUIDE.md` — what
  we evaluate, the 3 layers, tiers (smoke/full/stress), fixture types
  (synthetic vs real captures), runner output, capture flow, cadence,
  diagnosing failures, adding evals and assertions.
- **Eval definitions:** `evals/model-apps/genpage/evals.json` — 18 evals
  with prompts, answers, and expectations.
- **Fixtures:** `evals/model-apps/genpage/fixtures/<eval-id>-<slug>/` —
  one folder per captured or synthetic run. Each contains the `.tsx`,
  `workflow-log.md`, `genpage-plan.md`, and (when applicable)
  `entity-creation-log.md` and `RuntimeTypes.ts`.

Run on every PR that touches the skill, agents, rules, or evals:

```bash
node evals/model-apps/genpage/run-layer-1.js --tier smoke
node evals/model-apps/genpage/run-layer-2.js --tier smoke
```

### /app-builder — offline structural harness

A data-driven, **offline** eval harness at `evals/model-apps/app-builder/`
(sibling of `genpage/`). Grades **structural per-stage facts** — not `.tsx`
snapshots — using the plugin's own pure primitives. No live env required.

- `evals.json` + `fixtures/<n>-<slug>/app-spec.json` — data-driven cases
- `lib/facts.js` — per-stage fact computation (`schema-facts.js` + `app-spec.js` primitives)
- `lib/assertions.js` — assertion text → check function registry
- `run-app-builder.js` — TAP v13 runner (run from the repo root)
- `EVAL_GUIDE.md` — grading guide (see [`evals/model-apps/app-builder/EVAL_GUIDE.md`](../../evals/model-apps/app-builder/EVAL_GUIDE.md))

Per-stage oracles: `author` (validate + lint), `plan` (`planFor`), `data`
(`schema-facts.js` normalized tables/columns/relationships), `ui` (view/chart/form
intent facts), `app` (sitemap facts + nav graph), `verify` (`verifySpec` reconcile).

```bash
# From repo root:
node evals/model-apps/app-builder/run-app-builder.js
```
