// PURE + I/O-free. Given the CURRENT spec and the spec that was LAST APPLIED to the env (persisted by
// build-model-app.js after a successful --apply as <workspace>/last-applied.json), it reports which
// build phases' inputs actually changed. Today this is ADVISORY — surfaced in the dry-run so the
// author/agent can SEE that "only pages changed" instead of re-reading 85 steps. It does NOT yet gate
// --apply: running ONLY the changed phases safely requires each phase to self-hydrate its cross-phase
// dependencies (e.g. the pages phase currently HALTS unless app-shell ran in the same invocation —
// sdk-build.js "pages-requires-app"), which needs a per-phase audit + live validation. That execution
// step is tracked in docs/app-builder-capabilities.md; this module is its correct, testable foundation.
//
// Comparison is a stable-stringify deep-equal (key-order-independent), so re-ordering keys in the spec
// file does NOT report a false change. Any real value change in a phase's slice marks it changed. When
// no prior snapshot exists (first build, or a spec authored elsewhere), every phase is "changed".

// The slice of the spec each phase consumes. `publish` is intentionally absent — it always runs (it's
// the final flush) and has no author-owned input to diff. Order matches the engine's PHASES pipeline.
