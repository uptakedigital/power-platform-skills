// (app-spec.js), the setting-name map (verify-spec.js), the build's requested flag set
// (sdk-build.js) and the SDK's own module-private map — and they had already drifted in a way that
// re-opened the bug this area exists to fix: the BUILD writes a default for every feature whenever
// `spec.ai` is present, but verify only reconciled the features a spec DECLARED. A spec carrying
// `ai.summaries` and no `ai.appFeatures` therefore had three features written and ZERO verified,
// so `--verify` reported a clean PASS for features the platform may never have stored — exactly the
// false PASS of ADO 6603383, just narrowed rather than removed.
//
// Everything here is pure except the two `read`-driven proof helpers, which take an injected reader
// so both the build engine and the verifier can share one implementation of the authoritative query.

// `NLGridSearchSetting`. Verify must read the PER-APP setting, because that is what the build wrote
// and what is in force for this app. Conflating the two is exactly the bug that made NL grid search
// report "applied" while writing nothing (ADO 6560699 / 6603383).
