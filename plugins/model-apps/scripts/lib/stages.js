// Canonical ordered list of the engine's 16 build phases. This is the SINGLE source of truth —
// sdk-build.js imports it from here so the stage layer and the engine can never drift. Order is
// load-bearing: phases run top-to-bottom, and downstream phases depend on earlier ones (e.g. the
// app phase consumes forms/views/charts built earlier). `business-rules` runs after `forms` because
// a rule is authored against the entity's COLUMNS (data-model) but belongs with the record UI it
// governs; it has no dependency on the command bar. `business-process-flows` sits next to it for the
// same reason and with the same dependency (entity + columns only): a BPF's XAML binds stage steps
// to attribute logical names, nothing later. Note it deliberately does NOT need to run after
// `security` — a BPF's role grants are privileges on the backing table that activation creates, so
// if/when they are authored they belong in the `security` phase (which runs later and already owns
// role creation), not here. The `security` phase runs AFTER app-shell because a persona role grants
// read on (and is associated to) the app module created there, so the generated app opens for that
// persona. See docs/app-builder-design.md §6.

// User-facing stages, each a contiguous range of engine phases. Stages are the vocabulary the
// orchestrator narrates, gates consent on, and evals assert against — they do NOT rename or merge
// phases. `data`, `ui`, `app`, `publish` tile PHASES exactly (no gaps/overlaps); the design-only
// `author`, the code-gen `generate-pages`, and `verify` are orchestrator stages with no phase range
// and are intentionally absent from this map. `security` joins the `app` stage — authoring the
// persona access model is part of standing the app up for its users. See the design doc §5–§6.
