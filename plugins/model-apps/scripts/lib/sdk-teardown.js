// Teardown engine: reverse the app-builder build — delete exactly the artifacts a given
// App Spec declares, in dependency-safe order, via the SDK's delete methods. This is the
// first-class, classifier-safe counterpart to the manual delete recipe used during live
// verification: it only ever touches artifacts whose identity is resolved from a name/logical/
// uniquename the spec itself declares (an exact-match queryRecords filter per artifact), so it
// can never wildcard-scan or remove unrelated org data.
//
// Order (each the mirror of the build's create order — dependents before their dependencies):
//   1. app          — the app module (references the sitemap + dashboard/form/view/chart components)
//   1a. pages        — generative pages (uxagentproject + files) this build AUTHORED, per the page
//                      manifest. The SDK's deleteAppCascade no longer removes them: a
//                      page is REFERENCED by an app, not owned by one — another app's sitemap, or a
//                      form's UxAgentControl `RefId` in formxml, can point at the same row — so the
//                      SDK reports them and the owner decides. Runs AFTER the app so the app's own
//                      sitemap reference is already gone and the only dependency the platform can
//                      still report is a GENUINE other consumer; such a page is SKIPPED, not deleted.
//   2. dashboards    — systemform (type 0) rows, pinned as app components
//   3. commands      — appactions per entity (they reference the web-resource JS; delete first).
//                      The SDK's command delete is ENTITY-keyed (removes every appaction on that
//                      entity's bar in one call), so this passes the entity logical name, not an id.
//   4. forms         — systemform rows per entity (forms reference views/web-resources; deleted before tables)
//   4b. roles        — persona security roles. Deleted AFTER the forms and BEFORE the data model, and
//                      both halves of that are load-bearing:
//                        * after forms, because `forms[].securityRoles` writes the role id into the
//                          form's own `formxml` as a `<DisplayConditions>` entry, which the platform
//                          treats as a real dependency. MEASURED: deleting the role first answered
//                          `HTTP 400 … The Role(<id>) component cannot be deleted because it is
//                          referenced by 1 other components`, and the identical delete returned 204
//                          with zero reported dependencies once the forms were gone.
//                        * before tables, because a role holding a soon-to-be-deleted table's
//                          privileges could otherwise block that table's delete.
//                      SEC-1: only roles the SDK itself authored (marked on the role description) are
//                      deleted — never a hand-built or managed same-name role.
//   5. charts        — savedqueryvisualization rows per entity (deleted before tables)
//   6. views         — savedquery rows per entity (deleted before tables)
//   7. relationships — OneToMany/ManyToMany relationships (deleted before tables)
//   8. tables        — EntityDefinitions in REVERSE-topological order (a child's lookup references
//                      its parent, so children/referencing tables delete first). Deleting a table
//                      does NOT cascade forms/views/charts/relationships when cross-references exist
//                      (e.g. a form subgrid references another table's view), so teardown deletes
//                      them explicitly first.
//   9. web-resources — webresourceset rows (form/command JS, table-icon SVG/raster images, and the
//                      build's generated default app icon) — deleted AFTER tables: a table's icon
//                      web resource is referenced by the TABLE itself, so it can't be removed until
//                      the table is gone (form JS is referenced by forms, already deleted above).
//  10. global-choices — shared option sets, deleted after the tables whose columns bound them.
//  11. solution      — the (now-empty) solution container, deleted last.
//
// planTeardown(spec) is pure (no I/O) — the dry-run plan + the unit-test surface. runTeardown
// executes it via an injected SDK client and emits the same { phase, status, label, n, total,
// detail? } progress events the build engine does, so the orchestrator narrates teardown with
// the identical phase-grouped, status-marked log.
