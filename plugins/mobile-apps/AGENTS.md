# AGENTS.md — Code Apps Native Plugin (Preview)

This file provides guidance to AI Agents when working with the **mobile-app** plugin.

> **Status:** v0 — 24 skills + 5 agents authored. The latest Expo standalone template snapshot is bundled under `template/`. Read [README.md](./README.md) for the command list.

## What This Plugin Is

A plugin for building and deploying **Power Apps code apps that run as native mobile + web apps** using Expo + React Native + TypeScript. Connects to Power Platform via connectors using the standard `npx power-apps add-data-source` workflow.

The Expo template snapshot is distributed with this plugin under `template/` and published from [`plugins/mobile-apps/template`](https://github.com/microsoft/power-platform-skills/tree/main/plugins/mobile-apps/template). `/create-mobile-app` runs in fresh-template working-directory mode: the user starts in an installed template folder, then the skill validates and prepares it.

## Template source

The Expo template snapshot ships bundled inside this plugin at `template/`. It is synced from `microsoft/power-platform-skills` `main`, `plugins/mobile-apps/template/`. `/create-mobile-app` does not silently copy the bundled template over a user's folder; it expects a fresh installed template working directory and applies these preparation edits there:

| Edit | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `app.config.js`: `name`, `slug` | Replace `'Power Apps Dev Player'` / `'powerapps-dev-player'` with wizard answers |
| `package.json`: `name` | Replace `'powerapps-dev-app'` with the app slug |
| Remove an empty placeholder `power.config.json` | Preserve populated environment configuration; `npx power-apps init` creates a missing file |
| Remove legacy example hooks and query-client files | Preserve every artifact under `src/generated/` |
| `app/_layout.tsx`: add `tamaguiConfig` + `defaultTheme` | Use host light/dark defaults until generated brand themes are explicitly wired |
| `tsconfig.json`: verify the host base | Package shims and `@/` aliases remain centralized in the native host |

Do not add preparation rewrites for `scheme`, `package`, `bundleIdentifier`, `src/playerConfig.ts`, `fingerprint.config.js`, or `native-runtime.json` unless those files exist in the synced main template.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Connector-first for data** — All Power Platform data access goes through connectors and generated services in `src/generated/`. No direct Graph / Azure REST calls.
2. **Native code is allowlist-bounded; pure JavaScript is app-scoped.** Expo modules and packages that ship native source, a podspec, codegen configuration, an Expo module/config plugin, or platform projects must already exist in `template/package.json`. The rewrap binary is built from a pre-built base, so adding those packages to an app cannot add their native code. Do not classify a package from its name alone: a `react-native-*` package can still be pure JavaScript. For an explicit library request or an approved use case that benefits from an established library, the planner may select a compatible pure-JavaScript package, pin it in the app's `package.json`, and install it before builders use it; no Android/iOS rebuild is required. Do not bundle optional libraries such as `react-native-calendars` in the base template. Follow [`shared/references/javascript-dependency-planning.md`](shared/references/javascript-dependency-planning.md). `expo-haptics` remains runtime-banned even if it appears in a future template (see [`agents/screen-builder.md`](agents/screen-builder.md) HARD RULE). The native boundary and reconciliation rule are in [`skills/add-native/SKILL.md`](skills/add-native/SKILL.md).
3. **Fresh-template mode** — `/create-mobile-app` validates and prepares an existing fresh Expo standalone template working directory. Do not silently copy the bundled `template/` snapshot over the user's folder.
4. **Safety guardrails** — Confirm before deploys, before global installs, before edits outside the project root.
5. **Memory bank** — Persist `memory-bank.md` in the project root.
6. **Plan mode** — Enter plan mode before multi-file work; per-section approval gates (data model → native APIs → screen plan).
7. **Persisted plan** — Write `native-app-plan.md` (Mermaid ER + per-screen specs + native capabilities matrix) as the source of truth that sub-skills `Read`.
8. **CLI compatibility** — Use `npx power-apps ...` for code-app lifecycle and data-source commands. Use `scripts/resolve-environment.js` plus `az` tokens for Dataverse environment URL/tenant discovery and Azure/Entra operations. See [`shared/shared-instructions.md`](./shared/shared-instructions.md).
9. **Agent invocation namespace** — All `Task` invocations of agents in this plugin MUST use the fully-qualified `mobile-app:<agent-name>` form (e.g. `mobile-app:native-app-planner`, `mobile-app:screen-builder`). Bare names like `native-app-planner` return `Agent type 'native-app-planner' not found` because Claude Code namespaces all plugin agents by plugin name.
10. **Plugin isolation** — `hooks/hooks.json` is limited to fail-open telemetry start hooks. They never validate, mutate, or block tool calls. Do not add write/validation hooks: mutating skills follow the changed-file gate in `shared/shared-instructions.md`, and final-artifact agents invoke `scripts/validate-mobile-files.js` directly.
11. **Invocation metadata** — Public entry skills use `user-invocable: true` and remain model-invocable. Bundled implementation helpers use both `user-invocable: false` and `disable-model-invocation: true`; their owner reads `SKILL.md` directly. Hidden standalone workflows such as `assign-offline-profile` and `preview-offline-scope` use `user-invocable: false` without disabling model invocation because no owner reads them directly. Agents use `user-invocable: false` without `disable-model-invocation` so qualified `Task` delegation remains available.
12. **Sub-agent return-status protocol** — Every agent in this plugin (`native-app-planner`, `data-model-architect`, `screen-planner`, `screen-builder`) MUST return a status code as the **literal first line** of its final message. Orchestrators (skills that invoke agents via `Task`) MUST parse the first line and branch:

    | Code | Meaning | Orchestrator action |
    |---|---|---|
    | `DONE` | Completed cleanly | Log and continue |
    | `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS: <list>` | Worked but flagged doubts | Surface to user before next step; record in `memory-bank.md` |
    | `NEEDS_CONTEXT: <missing>` | Cannot proceed without more info | Re-dispatch with the info filled in (cap 2 retries) |
    | `BLOCKED: <reason>` | Hit a hard wall | STOP, escalate to user, never silently retry |

    Hard rules:
    - Status code is the literal first line — no `Status:` prefix, no backticks, no preamble. After it, blank line, then the agent's normal summary.
    - Agents MUST NOT downgrade `BLOCKED` to `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` to keep the workflow moving — the orchestrator's job is to handle the block, not the agent's.
    - `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` requires at least one concern. If none, use `DONE`.
    - Special early-return signals (`INDUSTRY_CONFIRM_REQUESTED:`, `DESIGN_VIBE_REQUESTED:`) pre-date this protocol and remain in effect — they are special-cased "ask the user one question and re-spawn me" handoffs, not terminal returns.
    - The canonical orchestrator handler lives in [`skills/create-mobile-app/SKILL.md`](./skills/create-mobile-app/SKILL.md) Step 3.0. Future skills that spawn agents should reference it rather than duplicating the switch.
## Telemetry

Mobile Apps bundles the canonical stdlib-only telemetry helpers from the repo-root `shared/telemetry/lib` at `scripts/lib/telemetry/lib`. Edit the shared source first, then refresh this physical copy in the same change; never copy another plugin's `ikey.json` or resolver.

- **Lifecycle:** `UserPromptSubmit` records explicit slash-command starts and `PreToolUse(Skill)` records programmatic Skill-tool starts; both may fire for one visible slash command. `UserPromptSubmit` payloads differ by host — Claude Code passes the raw `/mobile-app:<skill>` text, Copilot CLI pre-expands it to a `<skill-context name="<skill>">` wrapper and emits no Skill pre-tool event — so both shapes must stay recognized or manual runs go uncaptured. Marked workflow boundaries emit explicit checkpoints through `scripts/emit-telemetry-checkpoint.js`; do not broaden hook matchers to observe commands. Every tracked operational skill has checkpoints; the `telemetry` preference skill is intentionally exempt because changing the preference can suppress one side of its own checkpoint lifecycle. Do not infer `skill_completed`, duration, or outcome from hook boundaries.
- **Coverage and attribution:** `scripts/lib/mobileapp-hook-utils.js` discovers every user- or model-invocable top-level skill, including `telemetry`. Direct-read helpers with `disable-model-invocation: true` are not independently invoked and are excluded. Bare and `mobile-app:`-qualified names are both attributed; explicitly foreign plugin namespaces are excluded.
- **Session correlation:** Stable host session ids pass through unchanged. Copilot CLI reports a transient `call_*` id to nested-agent hooks, so `resolveCopilotRootSessionId` in `scripts/lib/mobile-telemetry.js` resolves it to the unique recent UUID session whose local `~/.copilot/session-state/<uuid>/events.jsonl` structurally owns that `agentId`, reading only a bounded tail. Keep host-specific quirks contained in that one function. The verified root is cached as one atomic 30-minute alias file per hashed call id so fresh hook processes reuse it; aliases hold no prompts, cwd, or tool arguments and are never transmitted. Missing, stale, malformed, or ambiguous state fails open to the original id, and Claude Code and Codex ids are not rewritten.
- **Privacy:** Mobile Apps sends no prompt, tool input, cwd, path, URL, credential, username, hostname, Dataverse org/tenant ID, or Entra object ID. The dynamic `eventInfo` contains only `invocationSource` (`prompt`, `pretool`, or `checkpoint`), a random per-project `appInstanceId` (or `null` outside a prepared project), and optional author-defined checkpoint `additionalInfo` validated as `snake_case` with a 64-character limit.
- **Destination and controls:** Mobile-owned `scripts/lib/mobile-telemetry-dispatcher.js` maps shared events to the Power Apps `event` stream configured by `scripts/lib/telemetry/ikey.json`. The repository `disabled` switch is a hard-off; user and CI opt-outs suppress transmission while preserving the local diagnostic mirror.
- **CI:** Every Mobile Apps test job must set `POWER_PLATFORM_SKILLS_TELEMETRY_MOBILE_APP_OPTOUT=1`. The single positive wire test clears that backstop only in its child process and routes the event to `POWER_PLATFORM_SKILLS_FAKE_HTTPS`; all other positive tests remain opted out and exercise the local mirror.

## Decisions made

- ✅ Markdown plan with Mermaid (no HTML rendering)
- ✅ **Per-section approval gates** in the planner (data model → native APIs → screen plan)
- ✅ `/edit-app` skill for post-generation app iteration: updates the approved plan delta, applies Dataverse/native/design/screen mutations, verifies, and refreshes preview output. `--plan-only` is the explicit docs-only escape hatch.
- ✅ Single `/deploy` skill — `npm run build` + `npx power-apps push`; no local native compile, no OTA in v0
- ✅ Connection model: per-environment connections, with platform-specific auth (`expo-msal-intune` on native, `expo-auth-session` on web)
- ✅ Auth: `/create-mobile-app` resolves the tenant from the selected Power Platform environment (`scripts/resolve-environment.js`), writes that tenant to `auth.config.json`, then lets the user paste an app registration client ID, create one from the Power Apps Wrap page and paste it, or skip auth for later. `/set-app-registration-native` is a manual helper for the same Wrap-page + pasted-client-ID flow.
- ✅ `/add-native` v0 scope: camera, location, push, biometrics, secure-store (already in template)
- ✅ Template is supplied as a fresh `microsoft/power-platform-skills/plugins/mobile-apps/template#main` folder before `/create-mobile-app` runs; users materialize it with `degit`, run `npm install`, then invoke the skill from that folder. The skill validates/prepares the folder and runs `npx power-apps init`.
- ✅ `brand/` directory convention: `/design-system` (Step 6.75) writes `brand/design-system.md` (spec), `brand/tokens.ts` (importable Tamagui tokens), and `brand/design-system.html` (visual gallery). Screen-builders MUST read `brand/design-system.md` if present; `## Negatives` = HARD RULES. `/create-mobile-app` Step 9b imports `brand/tokens.ts` via `skills/design-system/references/tamagui-integration.md`. Projects without `brand/` fall back to `## Design Direction` only — no breakage.
- ✅ Offline profile creation is **author-only in v0.1** — `/setup-offline-profile` and `/enable-tables-offline` POST `mobileofflineprofile` / `mobileofflineprofileitem` / `mobileofflineprofileitemassociation` to Dataverse and write `offline-profile.json` to the project, but do NOT scaffold offline runtime code (SQLite store, sync engine, write queue) into the generated app. Runtime support is gated on upstream `@microsoft/power-apps-native-host` confirmation.
- ✅ Custom filter mode (`recorddistributioncriteria=3`, `profileitemrule` → `savedquery`) is **deferred to v0.5**. v0.1 supports Related-rows-only / All-records / Organization-rows radio options only.
- ✅ `offline-profile-architect` agent follows the existing `mobile-app:` namespace + status-code protocol (`DONE` / `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS:` / `NEEDS_CONTEXT:` / `BLOCKED:`). Read-only — proposes scope; never mutates Dataverse. Mutation lives in `/setup-offline-profile` after the 3 gates.
- ✅ **Offline profile ↔ schema reconciliation across the lifecycle.** Any schema change (`/add-dataverse`, `/setup-datamodel`, `/edit-app`) reconciles an existing offline profile, and `/deploy` gates the final push on offline coverage. Mechanism: `scripts/offline-profile-delta.js` — a purely LOCAL, no-network diff of `.datamodel-manifest.json` (schema) vs `offline-profile.json` (offline coverage) reporting `missingTables` + new columns; `status` ∈ `no-manifest`/`no-profile`/`in-sync`/`delta`/`error` (exit 0 = ran, 1 = fatal). It is distinct from `verify-offline-profile.js`, which is a Dataverse-network drift check of the snapshot vs the live published profile. Column delta is computed against a per-table `schemaColumns` baseline (all schema columns present at reconciliation time), written by `/setup-offline-profile`, `/add-table-to-offline-profile`, and refreshed by `/edit-offline-profile` — NOT against the curated `selectedColumns`, so deliberate exclusions aren't false-flagged; legacy snapshots without it degrade to table-only delta. The one canonical flow (prompt wording, reconcile ordering, deploy gate/override) lives in [`shared/references/offline-profile-reconciliation.md`](shared/references/offline-profile-reconciliation.md); the four skills reference it rather than duplicating it. Orchestrator-invoked `/add-dataverse` (`--skip-planning`) suppresses its own Step 8.5 so the orchestrator owns reconciliation once.
