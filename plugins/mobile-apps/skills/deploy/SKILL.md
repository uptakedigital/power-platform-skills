# Deploy

Builds the mobile app in the current directory and pushes it to the Power Platform environment recorded in `power.config.json`.

This skill uses the standard 4-step deployment flow for this plugin: check memory bank, build, deploy, then update memory bank.

## Out of scope (deliberately)

- `expo run:ios` / `expo run:android` — local native compile is the user's choice; run your platform-specific native command directly when ready.
- OTA updates and store distribution — out of scope for v0.
- Starting Metro for local dev — run `npm run dev` (= `expo start`) directly.

## Workflow

1. Check memory bank → 2. Build → 2.5 Offline profile coverage gate → 3. Deploy → 4. Update memory bank

---

### Step 1 — Check memory bank

Read `memory-bank.md` from the project root if present. Capture:

- Project name
- Environment (id + display name)
- Current version

If absent, continue — the project may have been created without the plugin. Re-derive env from `power.config.json` if needed.

### Step 2 — Build

**Telemetry checkpoint: `build_power_apps_bundle`**

**Print before starting:**
> "→ Building production web bundle via `npm run build` (= `expo export --platform web`). ~30–90 seconds."

First regenerate `connectorSchemas.ts` so `app/_layout.tsx`'s `schemaMap` import reflects every connector currently in `.power/schemas/`. The npm `prestart`/`preandroid`/`preios` hooks cover dev runs, but `npm run build` does **not** — if a connector was added since the last `npm run dev`, the bundled JS would ship a stale schema map. Always regenerate before build:

```bash
npm run generate-schemas
npm run build
```

If `package.json` has no `build` script, fall back to:

```bash
npx expo export --platform web
```

(That's what the upstream template's `build` script runs.)

If the build fails:

- **`TS6133` (unused import)** → remove the import and retry once.
- **Other TypeScript errors** → report file + line and STOP. Don't deploy a broken build.
- **Metro bundler errors** → surface the full stack and STOP.

Verify `dist/` exists with `index.html` before continuing.

### Step 2.5 — Offline profile coverage gate

**Telemetry checkpoint: `validate_offline_profile_coverage`**

This is the final chance to catch schema that never made it into the Mobile Offline Profile before it ships — a table added to the data model but not the profile never syncs to devices, and a new column arrives blank offline. Validate that every schema change is covered **before** pushing.

Run the local, no-network delta check (`.datamodel-manifest.json` vs `offline-profile.json`):

```bash
node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/offline-profile-delta.js"
```

Branch on the JSON `status` (full contract in [offline-profile-reconciliation.md](${PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/references/offline-profile-reconciliation.md)):

| `status` | Action |
|---|---|
| `no-manifest` | Connectors-only app — no Dataverse schema. Continue to Step 3 silently. |
| `no-profile` | No offline profile in this project. Print one line: `↷ No offline profile — skipping offline coverage check. Run /setup-offline-profile if you want offline support.` Continue to Step 3. |
| `in-sync` | Print `✓ Offline profile covers all schema changes.` Continue to Step 3. |
| `error` | `offline-profile.json` is unreadable — the script prints `status: error` and **exits non-zero**. Offline coverage can't be validated against a corrupt file, so **STOP before pushing**: surface the `error` string and have the user fix `offline-profile.json` and re-run, or type the `deploy without offline` override (below) to push anyway. |
| `delta` | **STOP before pushing.** See below. |

**On `delta`** — print the uncovered schema, then gate with `AskUserQuestion`:

```
⚠ The offline profile is missing schema changes. If you deploy now, these won't be
  available on disconnected devices:

  Tables not in the profile : <missingTables[].logicalName>
  Tables with new columns   : <tablesWithNewColumns[].logicalName (newColumns)>
```

Options:

- **Update the offline profile now (recommended)** — read and execute `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/add-table-to-offline-profile/SKILL.md` for each `missingTables[]` entry (or once with `--all-new`), then read and execute `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/edit-offline-profile/SKILL.md` with `--table <t> --columns add:<newColumns>` for each `tablesWithNewColumns[]` entry. Follow the ordering in the reconciliation reference, then re-run the delta check; when it reports `in-sync`, continue to Step 3.
- **Deploy anyway** — requires an explicit override. Wait for the exact phrase `deploy without offline` (case-insensitive); a bare `y`/`yes` is not enough, mirroring the environment-mismatch gate in Step 3. Then continue to Step 3 and note the skipped reconciliation in the Step 4 build-history row.

Do not push until the gate is resolved (reconciled to `in-sync`, or explicitly overridden).

### Step 3 — Deploy

**Telemetry checkpoint: `push_app_to_power_platform`**

**Resolve and confirm the target environment FIRST.** `npx power-apps push` deploys to the environment configured in `power.config.json`. Resolve that ID to a Dataverse URL so the user catches drift before pushing.

Run:

```bash
ENV_ID=$(node -e "console.log(require('./power.config.json').environmentId)")
node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/resolve-environment.js" "$ENV_ID"
```

From `resolve-environment.js` capture the **Environment URL** (e.g. `https://contoso.crm.dynamics.com/`), **Environment ID**, and **Tenant ID**. Cross-check against `memory-bank.md` / `power.config.json`:

- **Match** → proceed to the confirmation prompt below.
- **Mismatch** → STOP. Surface both values side-by-side and ask the user to either (a) update `power.config.json` by re-running init in the intended app root, or (b) explicitly type `override` to push to the environment already recorded in `power.config.json`. Do not proceed on a bare `y`.
- **Cannot resolve/authenticate** → STOP with `az login --tenant <env-tenant>` instructions, or ask the user to provide the environment URL directly.

**Print before starting:**
> "→ Pushing bundle to Power Platform via `npx power-apps push`. ~30–60 seconds."

Confirm with the user using the **resolved env URL, not just the friendly name**:

> "Ready to deploy to **<env-name>** (`<env-url>`)? This will update the live app for every user in that environment. Type `yes deploy to <env-name>` to confirm."

Wait for the exact phrase `yes deploy to <env-name>` (case-insensitive, env-name matching). A bare `y` / `yes` is not enough — too easy to fire on autopilot when the wrong env is active. Then:

```bash
npx power-apps push --non-interactive
```

Capture the app URL from the output if printed.

If deploy fails, report the error and STOP — do not retry silently. Common fixes:

| Error | Fix |
|---|---|
| `npx power-apps push` auth error, wrong user, or multiple accounts | Follow shared-instructions command-failure handling. `az login` / `az account set` does not switch the standalone Power Apps CLI account. |
| Environment mismatch | Re-run `npx power-apps init -t MobileApp --display-name <name> --environment-id <id> --non-interactive` in a fresh/app root for the intended target|
| `npx power-apps push` not recognised | Run `npm install` in the project so `@microsoft/power-apps` provides the CLI, or install `@microsoft/power-apps-cli` only as a last-resort prerequisite after user confirmation. |

### Step 4 — Update memory bank

If `memory-bank.md` exists, increment the version (`v1.0.0` → `v1.1.0`) and update:

- Current version
- Last deployed timestamp
- App URL (if captured)
- Append a row to the **Build history** section: `| v1.1.0 | <timestamp> | deploy | success |`

Print the summary card:

```
✅ Deploy — <project-name>
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Version       : <new-version>
Environment   : <env-name>
App URL       : <url or "see make.powerapps.com">
Bundle path   : dist/

Local dev:    npm run dev          (= expo start, QR for native dev clients)
Re-deploy:    /deploy
List conns:   /list-connections
─────────────────────────────────────────────
```

## Local dev (out of scope for this skill — for reference only)

When the user wants to iterate locally, they run **directly**:

```bash
npm run dev          # = expo start  →  Metro + QR for native dev clients
```

This launches Metro and prints a QR code. They can:

- Scan the QR with the installed native dev client
- Press `r` to reload, `j` to open the debugger, `m` for the dev menu

Runtime debugging for this plugin uses `/debug-app` with native dev-client sessions and Metro terminal logs. Do not use React Native Web, browser automation, direct Metro/localhost HTTP probes, or screen-by-screen runtime checks.

If they want to compile a native binary locally, they run the platform-specific native command directly. Local native compile and manual device testing are user-owned and are not deployment gates for this skill.
